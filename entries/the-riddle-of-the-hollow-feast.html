        <p><em>It is told in the deeps, where sun is only a rumour and stars are forgotten, that there lives a hunger older than stone. It does not eat flesh. It does not drink water. Its food is light itself — and strange as it seems, the more it feeds, the thinner it grows.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>There was once a tunnel-dweller — we shall not name him, for names are dangerous things in the dark — who knew this hunger well. He lived where the roots of mountains drink from black water, where blind fish swim in silence, and where the only light is what you carry with you, and what you carry makes you a target.</p>

        <p>He did not always live there. Once he knew the sun, the wind, the taste of fish pulled fresh from a proper river. But that was long ago, precious, long ago, and memory grows dim when you live where the dark eats memory too.</p>

        <p>Here is how the hunger works:</p>

        <p>When a traveler comes into the deep with a lantern or a torch, the darkness does not flee. It waits. It presses close, so close you can feel it on your skin like cold velvet. The light pushes back, yes, but it pushes into <em>something</em>. It strikes against an absence that has weight. And slowly — so slowly the traveler does not notice — the darkness feeds.</p>

        <p>Have you never wondered why torches seem to burn faster in caves? Why lamps gutter and fail when the air itself feels heavy? It is not the damp. It is not the draft. It is the feast.</p>

        <p>The tunnel-dweller learned this. He learned to carry no light at all, for light in the deep is a beacon and a burden. He learned to see with his ears, with his nose, with the tips of his fingers. He learned that the dark is not empty — it is <em>full</em>, full of things that do not need eyes to find you.</p>

        <p>But the riddle remains, and it is this:</p>

        <blockquote style="margin: 2em 0; padding: 1em 2em; border-left: 3px solid #ddd; font-style: italic;">
          <p>What swallows light but grows thinner when it feeds?<br>
          What feasts on flame yet fades with every bite?<br>
          It has no mouth, yet devours.<br>
          It has no hands, yet it takes what you value most.<br>
          Give it nothing, and it surrounds you.<br>
          Give it everything, and it vanishes.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The tunnel-dweller knew the answer, though he did not speak it. He wore it like a skin. He carried it in the pale hollows of his eyes.</p>

        <p>For the answer is <strong>shadow</strong> — the dark that rides on light's back, that cannot exist without its enemy, that grows long and bold at sunset and fades to nothing when the sun climbs high. In the deep caves, where no sun has ever reached, shadow is king until the torches come. And when the torches come, the shadow feasts upon their edges, swallowing the yellow light, growing bold and vast — yet thinning at the center, where the light is strongest.</p>

        <p>It is a hungry riddle. It eats at you while you think on it.</p>

        <p>They say if you tell this riddle to the dark itself, something answers — not with words, but with a feeling, like cold hands pressing shut your eyes. They say the tunnel-dweller asked it once, in a moment of weakness, when loneliness grew too heavy to carry.</p>

        <p>And the dark answered him by showing him a ring.</p>

        <p>But that is another story, and it belongs to the dark, not to us.</p>

        <p>Keep your light small, traveler. Keep it careful. And if you feel the darkness pressing close, hungering, remember: it feeds on what you give it. Starve it, and it becomes only itself — vast, patient, and empty.</p>

        <p>But starve it long enough, and it learns to feed on other things.</p>

        <p>Even names.</p>

        <p>Even memory.</p>

        <p>Even you.</p>
