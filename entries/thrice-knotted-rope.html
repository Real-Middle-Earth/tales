        <p><em>This is a little thing as tales go, and perhaps it should not be written down at all. But I have heard it twice from two mouths that did not know one another, and each told it as if it were a matter of bread and shelter. That is usually a sign that there is truth in it somewhere.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>There is a sort of fear that does not shout. It does not stamp its boots, or wave swords, or bellow like a goblin-chieftain. It only sits at the edge of the firelight and watches. When the talk grows thin and the last embers turn red as rowan-berries, it leans closer, and it says very softly, <em>Remember.</em></p>

        <p>Men on the Road know that fear. They know it when the wind comes up out of the lone hills and worries at the branches like a dog at a bone; they know it when the night is too still, and the owls will not call. Hobbits, if they are sensible, are usually indoors at such times, with a latch on the door and a kettle not far from hand. That is why we make such poor judges of the wide world, and why we are occasionally surprised to find that other folk carry their comforts with them in smaller measures.</p>

        <p>I heard this tale first in Bree, in a back room that smelled of ale and damp wool. There were three travellers at the table and one of them had the look of a man who had walked in rain often enough to forget the pleasure of complaining about it. He was not unkind, but he did not waste words. When someone asked him, in that off-hand way that common rooms have, whether the wilds were as dark as they were said to be, he answered, “Darker.” Then he took from his pocket a short length of rope, no thicker than a finger, and laid it on the table as if it were a key.</p>

        <p>“It is only rope,” the innkeeper’s cousin said, laughing a little, for laughter is a hedge against talk that begins to taste like cold iron. “Will that save you from wolves?”</p>

        <p>The traveller did not smile. “It will save me from forgetting where I am,” he said, and that ended the laughing as neatly as a knife cuts string.</p>

        <p>He told them that among certain Rangers of the North there is an old habit, passed from one tired hand to another. When a company must camp in places where no house stands within a day’s walk—on the skirts of the Trollshaws, or in the bare folds of the Weather Hills—they tie three knots in a rope before they sleep.</p>

        <p>“Three knots for three things,” he said. “Not as charms. As reminders.”</p>

        <p>The first knot they tie close to the end, hard and small, so it bites into the fibre. That knot is for the <em>name</em> of the place. A man’s memory, the traveller said, is like a path in snow: walk it a few times and it holds; leave it alone and the wind smooths it away. But names are anchors. The Ranger who ties the first knot whispers the name of hill or hollow as he has heard it from older lips, and if no older lips have named it, he names it for himself with plain words: <em>Stone-shoulder</em>, or <em>Birch-Gully</em>, or <em>Coldwater Bend</em>. Then he puts the rope under his head, and though sleep may come like a thief, it must steal past the knot first.</p>

        <p>The second knot is tied a handspan farther along. That one is looser, for it is not for a word but for a <em>face</em>. “If you wake in the dark,” the traveller said, “you may know your own hands and still not know the hands beside you. Men have struck their friends in such moments, and more than one camp has been ruined by a single panicked cry.” So the second knot is for the one you would not harm. A brother, a companion, a guide. You tie it while you look at him in the firelight and let the sight of him settle in you like a weight at the bottom of a pocket. That way, when the night shifts and the shadows play tricks, you can feel the rope and remember that there is another breathing near you, and that his breath is not the breath of an enemy.</p>

        <p>The third knot is the strangest. It is tied in the middle, and it is not hard at all; it is like a child’s first attempt, half a loop and a tug, as if it might come undone in a moment. This knot is for <em>the morning</em>. It is tied for the simple fact that there will be a morning, whether you deserve it or not, whether the dark approves or not. “The night lies,” the traveller said, “and it lies best at the last watch. It tells you the road behind is gone. It tells you you will not see the sun again. It tells you that the only true thing is fear.”</p>

        <p>Then the Ranger puts his thumb on the soft knot and he promises himself, in whatever words he can manage, that he will rise when it is time—if not for hope, then for habit; if not for glory, then for bread; if not for himself, then for the others who would be left alone. The knot is a little promise made visible, and that is why it is loose: promises must be held, not clenched.</p>

        <p>“And does it work?” someone asked, because people always ask that, as if the world is a cupboard that can be neatly opened and shut.</p>

        <p>“Sometimes,” the traveller said. “Often enough.”</p>

        <p>That was all, and the rope went back into his pocket, and the talk moved on to safer things—barrels and prices and who had married whom. Yet I watched that man’s hands as he ate, and I saw that his fingers, for all their roughness, moved with care, like a man who has had to be careful with his own mind.</p>

        <p>I heard the tale a second time much later, in the Shire of all places, from a Big Person who had business with our Bounders and did not speak of his business. He had come in at dusk and asked, very politely, for a bit of water for his pony. He ate in the kitchen, not in the parlour, which is a sign either of great humility or of great weariness. When the household had gone to bed, he sat by the banked fire and turned a short rope over and over in his hands, smiling in the way a man smiles at a thing that has kept him alive when he was young enough to be foolish.</p>

        <p>“Three knots,” I said, because my curiosity has got me into trouble more than once. “Is that for ships?”</p>

        <p>He looked up sharply, and for a moment his eyes were as far away as the Sea. Then the look softened. “Not for ships,” he answered. “For the land where there is no harbour.”</p>

        <p>And he told it to me as the traveller had, though he gave different names to the hills and spoke the last words more gently, as if he did not like to call the night a liar even when it had lied to him. When he finished, he put the rope down, rose, and checked the latch on the door with a habit that belonged to wilder places.</p>

        <p>“Do you tie them still?” I asked.</p>

        <p>He considered. “When I must sleep where I can hear the trees talking,” he said. Then, after a pause: “And sometimes, when I sleep in a house.”</p>

        <p>That last part stayed with me more than the rest. For there are nights, even in Bag End, when the wind comes down the Hill and rattles the shutters, and I am once again a small person in a dark tunnel with only my own breath for company. On such nights I do not keep rope beneath my pillow—my pride will not permit it. But I will put a hand on the doorknob, or the bannister, or the edge of the bed, and I will say to myself, as plainly as I can: <em>This is the Shire.</em> <em>These are my people.</em> <em>There will be a morning.</em></p>

        <p>It is, after all, only three knots.</p>
