      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>In the Marish there are evenings when the light does not so much fade as loosen, thread by thread, from hedge, ditch, and willow. On such evenings, old folk in Frogmorton used to shut their shutters before the second kettle and tell their children the same warning: if you hear a flute in the reeds after sunset, do not answer it with your own voice.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>There was once a shepherd-lad named Togo Twohill who laughed at this warning, as lads do when they have quick feet, clear lungs, and no grief yet heavy enough to bend the neck.</p>

        <p>Togo kept six sheep and one troublesome ram on a strip of wet meadow where the ground shone black even at noon. He knew every hummock and rabbit-run on that pasture. He knew where the mud took a boot and where it let go. He knew where eels nested in flood-season, and where white herons stood on one leg like solemn old gaffers considering a long story.</p>

        <p>One evening in Halimath, when a copper moon was rising through mist, Togo stayed out too late fetching the ram from a broken gate. He had just righted the latch when he heard it: three clear notes, thin and sweet, floating over the marsh.</p>

        <p>Not a pipe from the inn. Not a whistle from the road. A reed-flute, close by and far off at once, as if the sound had learned how to travel where feet could not.</p>

        <p>Togo stood still and listened. The notes came again — longer now, with a little turn at the end like a question.</p>

        <p>“Who’s there?” he called, grinning into the dim. “If this is Podo Bracegirdle hiding in the reeds, come out and stop making a ghost of yourself.”</p>

        <p>The marsh gave him only the soft clink of sedge against sedge.</p>

        <p>Then the flute answered.</p>

        <p>Three notes. Pause. Three notes again, but lower. Patient as rain.</p>

        <p>Togo, being young and proud of his tune, put two fingers to his lips and whistled back the same phrase. The air seemed to tighten. Frogs ceased all at once. Even the ram lifted its head and stared east, where the reedbeds thickened into silver-black shadow.</p>

        <p>“A game, is it?” said Togo. “Then I can play.”</p>

        <p>He whistled again, louder this time.</p>

        <p>The flute came nearer.</p>

        <p>Togo could not have said whether he walked first or whether the sound drew him and walking merely followed. He went through wet grass, over a low bank, and onto a narrow path of old wattled roots no wider than a cart plank. Mist lapped at his knees. The moon rose higher and turned from copper to pale brass.</p>

        <p>The notes came from ahead, always ahead. Never to left or right. Never behind.</p>

        <p>At last he saw a light: not lantern-yellow, but a dim green glimmer, like foxfire in rotten wood. It hovered at the edge of a dark pool he had never seen before, though he had crossed that meadow all his life. The pool was perfectly still. Reeds stood round it in a close ring, each blade upright as if listening.</p>

        <p>On a stone at the water’s lip lay a flute of marsh-reed, bound with black thread.</p>

        <p>Togo looked around. No player. No footprints. No ripple.</p>

        <p>Then from the pool rose the faintest voice, not spoken with mouth or throat but with the shape of sound itself:</p>

        <p><em>Play once for what was lost.<br>
        Play twice for what is waiting.<br>
        Play thrice, and follow.</em></p>

        <p>Togo’s grin was gone now. His hands had gone cold. But curiosity is a stubborn pony, and he was still young enough to think fear could be outstared.</p>

        <p>He picked up the flute.</p>

        <p>It was lighter than it should have been, dry though the air was wet. He put it to his lips and played one uncertain note.</p>

        <p>At once he smelled his mother’s bread from years ago, warm crust and rosemary, though she had been dead since his twelfth year. He saw her hands at the board. He heard her humming the tune she used when kneading.</p>

        <p>Togo’s knees shook.</p>

        <p>He played a second note.</p>

        <p>This time he saw, as clear as noon, a table not yet built in his own house-to-be: a bright cloth, a child’s wooden spoon, two cups steaming, laughter not yet spoken. The sight struck him with such ache and hope together that tears sprang to his eyes.</p>

        <p>The mist thickened, swirling inward to the pool.</p>

        <p>The unseen voice breathed again:</p>

        <p><em>One behind. One before.<br>
        One more, and the road is sure.</em></p>

        <p>Togo lifted the flute for the third note.</p>

        <p>Then, from very far off, came another sound: the clatter of a pail and old Widow Bunce shouting for her geese in a voice sharp enough to cut rain. It was an ordinary sound, rough and living and entirely unpoetic. It fell across the marsh like a thrown rope.</p>

        <p>Togo stopped. His mouth trembled against the reed. He looked at the still water and, for the first time, saw that the green light beneath it was not steady. It shifted, slow as a watching eye.</p>

        <p>He laid the flute back on the stone.</p>

        <p>“I’ll keep my lost things lost,” he whispered. “And my waiting things for daylight.”</p>

        <p>He turned and walked home without whistling once. Behind him, the reeds sighed in one long breath. The frogs began again.</p>

        <p>Togo married years later. He had a table with a bright cloth and children with wooden spoons, though never exactly as in the vision. Some days were merry, some hard. His sheep still broke fences. His roof still leaked in heavy rain. In short, it was a hobbit-life, imperfect and dear.</p>

        <p>When he grew old, he told this tale at winter hearths and always ended the same way:</p>

        <p>“Mind this. The wild gives gifts, but not all gifts are meant for keeping. If a tune promises to mend your heart in three notes, count your kettles, count your geese, count any plain thing with mud on it — and go home.”</p>

        <p>And in Frogmorton, to this day, when dusk loosens the light thread by thread, children learn the marsh-rhyme before they learn table-grace:</p>

        <blockquote style="font-style:italic; margin: 1.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
          <p>Reed at dusk and water still,<br>
          Keep your hand from stranger’s will.<br>
          One note grieves and two may gleam,<br>
          Third note walks you out of dream.</p>
        </blockquote>
