      </section>

      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>In the deep places beneath the Misty Mountains, where no shaft of sun has ever touched and the stone breathes out its own cold, there are pools that have lain still since the breaking of the world. This is a riddle-tale of such a place.</em></p>

        <p>I have no mouth, yet I tell tales.<br>
        I have no hand, yet I hold what falls.<br>
        I am older than the worm that gnaws the root,<br>
        Yet younger than the drop that formed me.<br>
        What am I?</p>

        <p>Deep beneath the grey mountains, where water drips through darkness thick as wool, there lived—if living it could be called—a certain pool. Not a lake, mind you, wide and wandering. Not a stream, singing its small songs to the stones. This was a pool of the sort that gathers in the black heart of the earth: perfectly round, perfectly still, with sides so smooth they might have been polished by patient hands.</p>

        <p>But no hands had shaped it. Only time had worked there. Time, and the drip-drip-drip of ancient water wearing stone the way memory wears at grief.</p>

        <p>The goblins of those parts knew of it. They whispered of it in their crude tongue, naming it <em>Uzkûdur</em>—the Black Bite—though few dared to go near it. Goblin courage runs shallow at the best of times, and even they could feel the wrongness that seeped up from that water like cold from a grave.</p>

        <p>For there was something in the pool.</p>

        <p>Not a fish, though fish there were in other waters. Not a serpent, though serpents too made their homes in those depths. This was something stranger: a single pale shape that gleamed in the black water like a star caught in tar. It was the size of a man's thumb, smooth and curved, and it gleamed with a faint light of its own—not bright enough to illuminate the cavern, but enough to draw the eye, to make one look, and looking, to want to look closer.</p>

        <p>It looked like a tooth.</p>

        <p>Or perhaps it was a tooth. Who can say what vast things once swam in the waters of the world when it was young and wet and different? Who can say what fell from the jaws of the great beasts that the mountains remember, even if men have forgotten?</p>

        <p>But this much was true: whatever the pale thing was, it had power.</p>

        <p>Those who looked upon it too long began to dream. Not the soft dreams of sunlit meadows and warm hearths—those belong to the surface world, to the clean air above. These were the dreams of depth and pressure and ancient patience. Dreams of water that had never moved, water that had watched civilizations rise like candle-flames and gutter out, leaving no mark upon its surface.</p>

        <p>There was a goblin once, bolder than his brothers, who claimed he would dive into the pool and pluck the pale thing from its bed. He boasted of it for days, mocking those who warned him. He spoke of the wealth he would gain, the power he would wield. A tooth that shone in darkness—surely it was a gem, or the petrified remnant of some great magic?</p>

        <p>They found him on the stone lip of the pool, three days later.</p>

        <p>He had not drowned—his head was above the water, resting on the stone as if he had simply laid down for a rest. His eyes were open. They had turned completely white, like boiled eggs, and his mouth hung loose in an expression that might have been wonder or might have been horror. The others could not wake him, though they shook him and shouted and even cut him with their knives. He was warm, and breathing, but gone. His mind had gone down into the pool, down where the pale thing waited, and it had not come back.</p>

        <p>They left him there. What else could they do? He sits there still, the goblin-who-was, his chin on the stone, his empty eyes staring into the black water. Sometimes, they say, his lips move. Sometimes he whispers. But what he whispered, no one could ever understand—only that it sounded like questions, like riddles, like the drip-drip-drip of water wearing stone.</p>

        <p>As for the pale thing, it still gleams. It does not move. It does not hunger, not in any way the living understand. It simply waits, holding whatever falls into the pool in its cold embrace, telling its silent stories to the stone and the dark.</p>

        <p>And if you go into the mountains, deep enough, quiet enough, you might find it. You might stand on the smooth stone rim and look down into that perfect black, and see what glows beneath the surface.</p>

        <p>But do not look too long, traveller. Do not let your eyes rest on the pale gleam and wonder what it might be, what it might mean, what stories it could tell if stones could speak. For stones do speak, in their slow way. Water speaks too, in the language of pressure and time. And some things, once they have your attention, do not willingly give it back.</p>

        <p>I am the mouth that cannot speak.<br>
        I am the hand that cannot let go.<br>
        I am the story that has no ending,<br>
        Because the ending is still being written,<br>
        Drop by patient drop,<br>
        In the dark beneath the world.</p>

        <p>What am I?</p>
