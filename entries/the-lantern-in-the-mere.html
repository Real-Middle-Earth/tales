      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>In the wide lands east of the Mountains, where the ground will not decide whether it is earth or water, folk speak of a lantern that walks without feet.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>I did not set out to find it. No sensible traveller does. I was only trying to get out of the mire before the fog thickened and the reeds began their thin whispering—like old women trading names over a hedge.</p>

        <p>The path had been plain at noon: a low causey of packed stones, black with wet. But dusk makes liars of distances, and the mere was full of shallow channels that all looked alike when the last light bled away. I had the wind in my teeth and the taste of iron in my mouth, as though the whole world had been bitten by rust.</p>

        <p>Then I saw a small flame ahead.</p>

        <p>It was not a camp-fire; it was too neat for that, and too steady. It did not flicker in the wind. It stood at about the height of a man’s hand, as though someone held it just above the water to keep it from drowning. I stopped, and my boots sank with a quiet <em>gluk</em> in the mud, and I listened for footsteps.</p>

        <p>There were none.</p>

        <p>The lantern brightened as if it had heard my breath.</p>

        <p>Folk say that is how it begins: not with a shout, nor a sudden terror, but with something helpful-looking in a place where help feels like a miracle. I had been on the road too long, and I was hungry, and my shoulders ached from the weight of my pack. So I did the foolish thing that the mire is always offering the foolish to do.</p>

        <p>I followed.</p>

        <p>The lantern moved on at a walking pace. It did not bob, nor sway, nor cast a shadow of any arm. It drifted between reeds as though it knew every shallow and every sucking patch of mud. Each time I hesitated, it would pause, and the flame would swell a little, warm as a kitchen window seen from the lane. Each time I stepped forward, it would go on again, patient as a cat.</p>

        <p>After a while I began to smell smoke—not peat-smoke, nor wood-smoke, but the scent of tallow candles and clean hearthstone. It was the smell of indoors. It was the smell of home.</p>

        <p>That was when it began to bargain.</p>

        <p>Not with words. I heard no voice, and yet memories rose in me like fish breaking the surface. A small hand on my cheek. A laugh in a garden. Bread torn warm and shared by the door. The lantern did not show me these things as pictures; it made them <em>real</em>, so real that my eyes stung and my throat tightened, and I walked faster without meaning to.</p>

        <p>In the fog, my own life became a lighted room, and I was outside it, trying the latch.</p>

        <p>The lantern led me to a stretch of water as black as a closed eye. No stones showed here; the causey had vanished. Reeds leaned inward, and the fog lay low. The lantern hovered above the dark, and its flame steadied and shone as if it had found what it wanted.</p>

        <p>And in the water, something looked back.</p>

        <p>I do not mean the dead faces that some have seen in those fens—cold masks with weeds in their hair. No; it showed me a face I knew, and it was <em>smiling</em>. It was my mother, as she had been when I was small and the world was no wider than her apron. She held a lamp too, and she lifted it a little, beckoning.</p>

        <p>My feet moved. Mud sighed around my ankles like a warning too tired to be spoken aloud.</p>

        <p>Then—bless the stubbornness of Men, if it is a blessing—I remembered something a grey-bearded Ranger once told me on a different road.</p>

        <p>“If the wild offers you what you most want,” he said, “it is because it means to keep you. A gift that drags you by the heart is a chain.”</p>

        <p>I stopped with water at my shins. The lantern did not move. The flame did not flicker. My mother’s face in the dark did not change. The smile held, too patient, too still.</p>

        <p>So I did the one hard thing left to a traveller: I turned my eyes away from the light.</p>

        <p>I took a step back—then another. I said my own name out loud, clumsy in the fog, like an iron nail driven into rotten wood. I said the names of three places I had slept that week. I spoke of plain things: my boots, my knife, my pack, the ache in my shoulder. I spoke as though I were making a list for a market, because lists are honest, and longing is not.</p>

        <p>The lantern’s flame shrank. The smell of hearthstone faded. The mere became only water again, cold and unfriendly.</p>

        <p>And when I looked up, the lantern was gone.</p>

        <p>I found the causey again by accident, not by any light but the paleness of the fog and the dull sense of stones underfoot. I slept that night with my cloak over my face, because every time I closed my eyes I saw the smile in the water, waiting.</p>

        <p>In the morning, the marsh was merely a marsh. Birds called. The wind moved the reeds. My boots were heavy with mud, and my stomach was empty, and I was alive, and those were all the comforts I required.</p>

        <p>That is why folk say: if you ever see a lantern in the mere, do not ask it where the road goes. It already knows.</p>
