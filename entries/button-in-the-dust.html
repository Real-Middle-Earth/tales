      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>There are days when the road gives you nothing at all but dust, and then there are days when it gives you a button.</em></p>

        <p>It was the sort of day when even the hedgerows seemed to hold their breath. The sun had burned the morning mist away early and left the air clear and thin, and the North-road lay pale as bone between the Shire and Bree. There was no rain in the look of the sky, only a bright emptiness that made the distance sharper than it had any right to be.</p>

        <p>A hobbit might ask what sensible folk were doing on such a road at such an hour, and I should agree with him; yet there I was, walking with my coat unbuttoned at the throat, because the day was warm and my pack sat high on my shoulders and I had promised myself I should see something of the world beyond my own front hedge. Promises, like buttons, are easily made and sometimes troublesome to keep.</p>

        <p>Now, I do not mean that I found the button. Not at first. It found me, if one may speak in that manner, by catching the corner of my eye with the smallest wink of metal. I might have stepped over it without noticing, for it lay in a shallow rut where a cart-wheel had passed. Yet there it was: a button, brass (or something much like it), worn smooth at the edges, half-buried in the dust as if the road had tried to swallow it and grown bored halfway.</p>

        <p>I stopped, more from habit than reason. Hobbits are not built to ignore things that have fallen on the ground; we are raised among lost thimbles and dropped pennies, and we take notice of smallness. I bent, pinched it between finger and thumb, and rubbed away the dust. It was warm from the sun. On the back, scratched faintly, there was a mark—no writing fit to read, only a shallow line like a hook, as if someone had begun to carve a letter and thought better of it.</p>

        <p>“Well,” I said to no one in particular, for the road was empty, “you have come loose from something.”</p>

        <p>Buttons do come loose. That is their way. Coats wear, threads fray, and sometimes the honest strain of living pops a fastening free. Yet a button on a road is a little different from a button on a hearth-rug. A button on a road is a sign of a traveller, and travellers, as you know, have a habit of being in want of things.</p>

        <p>I put the button in my pocket. It made a small weight there, not heavy, but present enough that I felt it with each step, like a reminder tapped by an impatient finger.</p>

        <p>By midday I had come within sight of Bree-hill, a green swelling in the land with the town crouched at its foot like a dog that has settled down but kept one ear pricked. The road grew busier. A farmer with a cart of turnips passed me and called a good day. A pair of Men in travel-stained cloaks walked southward with their heads down, speaking little. A pony, riderless, trotted along the verge as if it had lost its owner and decided the road was as good a guess as any.</p>

        <p>It was the pony that decided the matter.</p>

        <p>For just outside the Bree-land, where the hedges were lower and the fields more open, I saw a figure standing by the roadside, not moving. At first I took him for one of the hedge-posts, so still was he, with his cloak the same colour as the dry grass. Then he turned his head, and I saw the flash of a face under the hood: lean, weather-browned, with eyes that did not miss much.</p>

        <p>The pony went to him at once, as if it knew him, and nosed his hand. The man laid a palm upon its forehead, and the pony sighed and stood quiet. Only then did he look up at me.</p>

        <p>“Good day,” I said, because a hobbit who has met trolls in the wild does not forget his manners, and because I could think of nothing cleverer. “Have you lost your pony?”</p>

        <p>“Not lost,” he answered. His voice was low, and his words were plain, as if he was careful with them. “Only delayed.”</p>

        <p>He might have said more, but he did not, and I felt—oddly—that he had already weighed me as one weighs a loaf to see if it will be worth the coin. Perhaps he decided I was harmless. Most folk do.</p>

        <p>“Delayed,” I repeated, trying to sound wise. “Aye. The road does that.”</p>

        <p>His gaze dropped to my coat. It lingered on the front, and I became suddenly aware that my own buttons were all accounted for, thank you very much. Yet his look was not the look of a man counting another’s fastenings out of envy. It was the look of a man who had noticed that something was missing, and could not quite help noticing.</p>

        <p>“You are bound for Bree?” he asked.</p>

        <p>“For a meal,” I admitted. “And perhaps a bed, if the day grows late.”</p>

        <p>He nodded once. “Keep to the road. If you must stray, do it in daylight.”</p>

        <p>This was good advice, and might have ended there. Yet the button in my pocket chose that moment to make itself known again, as if it had heard the man’s voice and remembered its own proper place. I felt it under my fingers, and I drew it out.</p>

        <p>“This is a foolish question,” I said, for it seemed foolish even as I spoke, “but do you happen to be missing a button?”</p>

        <p>His eyes narrowed slightly, not with anger, but with attention. He held out his hand, and I placed the button in his palm. He turned it over, and for the first time his face changed—only a little, but enough that I saw he had been holding himself stiff as a drawn bowstring, and now the string eased.</p>

        <p>“Where did you find it?”</p>

        <p>“In the road,” I said. “A mile or two back, perhaps more. It looked lonely.”</p>

        <p>He gave a short, quiet breath that might have been a laugh, if he had remembered how. “Lonely, yes.”</p>

        <p>He reached beneath his cloak and drew out the edge of a coat I had not noticed—a darker garment, worn beneath, of good make but much mended. Near the collar there was a gap where a button ought to have been. He lifted the button to the light, matching it by memory rather than by sight. The mark on the back—the hook-like scratch—seemed to please him, though I could not have said why.</p>

        <p>“It is mine,” he said at last.</p>

        <p>I felt absurdly proud, as if I had returned a lost jewel rather than a cheap bit of metal. “Well then,” I said, “that is settled.”</p>

        <p>“Not quite,” he answered.</p>

        <p>Before I could ask what he meant, he bent and picked up a small stone from the roadside—a pebble the colour of smoke, with a pale streak through it. He rolled it between finger and thumb. “This road is watched,” he said, and his eyes moved over the empty fields as though the emptiness was only another kind of crowd. “Folk think only the great things matter: swords and banners, kings and councils. But the smaller things are often the hinges. A missing button is a loose cloak. A loose cloak is a chilled shoulder. A chilled shoulder is a man who sits by a fire instead of keeping to his patrol. And then…” He did not finish, but his glance went northward, and for a heartbeat the day felt less warm.</p>

        <p>I swallowed. “I only picked it up,” I said, suddenly wishing I had left it in the dust and gone on my comfortable way, as I had intended. “I did not mean to be a hinge.”</p>

        <p>That earned me another of those almost-laughs. “Hinges seldom mean to be hinges,” he said.</p>

        <p>Then, to my surprise, he took a small needle from somewhere in his sleeve, and a length of dark thread that might have been spider-silk for its fineness. With a few quick motions—motions practiced to the point of being quiet—he stitched the button back into place. His hands were rough, but precise. When he was done, he tugged once to test it, and the coat sat better on his shoulders.</p>

        <p>He looked at me then, and I saw something like weariness behind the watchfulness. “You have saved me a stop I could not afford,” he said. “Name your price.”</p>

        <p>Good gracious. A hobbit who is offered coin for a roadside kindness becomes very uncomfortable, for coin makes a transaction of what ought to be freely given. Yet I was not so foolish as to refuse a courtesy outright. I thought quickly, and found a compromise that sat better in my stomach.</p>

        <p>“If you are bound north,” I said, “and if you come to the Shire in your wanderings, then stop at Bag End in Hobbiton and accept a meal. That will do.”</p>

        <p>He stared at me for a moment, and I feared I had offended him with my boldness. Then his face softened in a way I had not expected from such a stern-looking fellow.</p>

        <p>“A meal is a better price,” he said. “And a dangerous one, for it makes debts linger.”</p>

        <p>“Hobbits are good at lingering,” I said, and this time I did manage a proper smile.</p>

        <p>He nodded, as if we had struck a bargain between equals. “If I can,” he said, “I will come.”</p>

        <p>We walked together a little way, the pony between us. He did not offer his name, and I did not press him. There are names that are given freely, and names that are carried like blades, shown only when needed. Yet as we neared the first houses of Bree, and the sound of people came to us—voices, a hammer on wood, a distant dog barking—he reached into his pocket and pressed something into my hand.</p>

        <p>It was not coin. It was the smoky pebble, the one with the pale seam, warmed now by his palm.</p>

        <p>“For your pocket,” he said. “So that when you put your hand in, you remember: the road is not only dust.”</p>

        <p>I turned it over. The pale seam caught the light like a thin line of moon, and for a moment I thought of rivers at night and lanterns in mist, and the strange way small lights can make rooms out of darkness.</p>

        <p>“Thank you,” I said, for that is what one says when given a gift that one does not quite understand.</p>

        <p>He touched the pony’s mane and looked once more up the road. “Keep your buttons,” he said, as if it was a proverb. “And keep your promises, if you can. They do more than you think.”</p>

        <p>Then he turned away, and within three steps he seemed to belong to the road again—part of its dust and its distance, one more traveller moving quietly between the places that folk mark on maps.</p>

        <p>I watched him go until the light and the land swallowed him.</p>

        <p>Afterward, when I sat that night in Bree with a mug of something respectable and a plate of something hearty, I found my hand returning again and again to the pebble in my pocket. It was only a stone. Yet it sat there with a steady weight, like a thought that will not be brushed aside.</p>

        <p>And in the morning, before I set out again, I checked every button on my coat twice.</p>
