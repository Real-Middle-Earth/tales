      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>In the late Third Age, when the names of great folk were carried by wind and rumour more than by heralds, there was a ford on a lesser river that did not appear on most maps.</em></p>

        <p>The river was not wide. In summer it was as friendly as a clear thought, braided about stones and loud with its own laughter. Yet even a small water may grow sharp in winter; and when it swelled, it spoke in a different tongue, low and urgent, as though it had learned secrets from the mountains and could not wait to pass them along.</p>

        <p>There was a post set beside that ford: old oak darkened by weather, with two iron rings that once had held a rope for travellers less sure of their footing. The rope was long gone. The rings remained, like the memory of a helpful hand.</p>

        <p>It was there, on a night of thin stars and thick mist, that a lantern burned.</p>

        <p>It was not a grand lantern, mind you—no bright jewel fit for a king’s hall. It was the sort of lantern a careful farmer might hang by a barn door when a ewe was close to lambing: glass a little clouded, brass dulled, a handle worn smooth by many fingers. The flame inside made a small, steady heart. It did not boast. It did not flicker in panic when the wind worried at it. It simply shone, and by shining said: <em>Here is a place you may find your way.</em></p>

        <p>Now, no one knew at first who lit it.</p>

        <p>Some said it was the ferryman who lived a mile upriver in a hut half-buried in turf, though he had never been one for lanterns before. Others said it was old Mistress Bunting from the nearest village, who had lost a son on a night like this and would not lose another if she could help it. A few, speaking into their cups as if the ale itself were a confidant, whispered that it was the work of Rangers—those half-seen folk with quiet boots and eyes that measured more than they said.</p>

        <p>But lanterns, like good deeds, do not come with labels pinned to them. A light is a light, and if it saves your ankle from a treacherous stone, you are not inclined to demand a signature.</p>

        <p>Only, this lantern did more than that.</p>

        <p>It called people.</p>

        <p>The first was a lad named Hildif, who had set out too late with a basket of smoked eels for an aunt and found the mist swallowing the road as a wolf swallows a bone. He would have turned back, but pride is a stubborn thing in young bones, and the thought of going home empty-handed felt worse than any cold. So he pressed on, and when his foot slipped on the slick edge of the ford he would have gone down hard and soaked, had he not seen that warm gold hanging in the vapour like a promise.</p>

        <p>He crossed with care then—one step, two, feeling for the river’s honest places with his toes—and when he reached the far side he put his hand to the lantern-post as if to thank it. The oak was cold as old grief.</p>

        <p>That should have been the end of it. He should have walked on, cheeks burning with embarrassment at his own foolishness, and told his aunt a tale of the weather and nothing more.</p>

        <p>Instead he heard a sound behind him: not the river, not the wind. Something like a sigh that had forgotten how to be quiet.</p>

        <p>He turned. The mist thickened and thinned in slow breaths. The lantern’s light made a little chamber in the fog, a room without walls. And on the edge of that room, just beyond the reach of warmth, a shape stood: small, hunched, and still as a stone that has listened too long.</p>

        <p>Hildif’s mouth went dry. His basket swung against his knee with a dull thump.</p>

        <p>“Who is there?” he called, trying to sound like a man, and coming out mostly like a boy.</p>

        <p>The shape did not answer with words. It moved, and the movement was wrong—too quick for something that had been so still, like a spider suddenly deciding it had waited long enough. It stepped nearer, and the lantern showed a face: pale as fish-belly, with eyes that shone not with lantern-light but with hunger for it.</p>

        <p>Not hunger for bread or meat. Hunger for <em>meaning</em>.</p>

        <p>Hildif backed away until his shoulders met the post. His fingers closed around the iron ring, cold and unforgiving. He could not run; the stones behind him were slick, and the river had no patience for panic. He could not shout; the mist ate sound like a greedy thing.</p>

        <p>He did the only sensible thing a frightened lad can do when he cannot flee.</p>

        <p>He looked at the lantern.</p>

        <p>That sounds foolish, perhaps, but he looked at it as one looks at a friend across a crowded room. He let his eyes rest on the steady flame and said in his heart, <em>Stay. Stay. Do not go out.</em></p>

        <p>And the flame did stay.</p>

        <p>The pale figure crept closer, and the lantern’s light, which had seemed so small a moment before, grew teeth. Not sharp teeth like a wolf’s, but the firm edge of truth. The fog thinned a little. The figure’s hands—thin, long-fingered—lifted, as if to cup the light and drink it.</p>

        <p>But when those hands entered the lantern’s glow, they trembled, and the creature hissed softly, the way ice hisses when it meets a hot pan.</p>

        <p>It was not that the lantern burned it. It did not. The light did not strike like a weapon. It simply revealed. And some things, when revealed, become suddenly ashamed of themselves.</p>

        <p>“No,” whispered the creature. The word came out broken, as if it had been a long time since it had needed language for anything but begging. “No, no… not <em>that</em>.”</p>

        <p>Hildif swallowed. “Then go away,” he managed.</p>

        <p>The creature’s eyes darted to the river, then to the darkness beyond the lantern’s reach. It rocked on its heels, torn between desire and fear, like a child who wants a sweet and knows it will hurt his teeth. At last it scuttled backward, fast as a bad thought, and vanished into the mist with another long sigh.</p>

        <p>Hildif stood trembling, his hand still on the iron ring. The lantern’s flame did not flicker. It did not preen. It simply kept its steady heart, as if such things happened every night and were no cause for comment.</p>

        <p>When Hildif finally found his voice again, he did not shout. He did not call for help that would not come. Instead, he said softly, “Thank you.”</p>

        <p>Then he took his basket and walked on, feeling older with each step, and not in a way he liked.</p>

        <p>He told no one at first.</p>

        <p>That too is a common thing. Not all truths sit easily at a breakfast table. Some feel too strange for daylight, too sharp for the mouth. Yet secrets, like rivers, have a way of finding their course.</p>

        <p>Within a week the village had a new habit: when the evenings grew cold and the mist came prowling, someone would walk to the ford and check the lantern.</p>

        <p>If the oil was low, they filled it. If the glass was streaked with soot, they cleaned it. If the wind had worried the door loose, they mended the latch. They did this quietly, without ceremony, as if it were simply another chore like sweeping ash from a hearth. In time no one could say who began it; it belonged to the village the way a well belongs to those who draw from it.</p>

        <p>And the lantern kept burning.</p>

        <p>It did not banish all shadows. It did not make wolves gentle or storms polite. But it made one small place in the world a little less lost. And because of that, folk began to feel—without quite naming it—that they had a say in whether the dark had its way.</p>

        <p>On the coldest night of that winter, when the river spoke in its urgent tongue and the mist lay on the fields like wool, a traveller came limping to the ford. He wore a cloak the colour of rain, and his hood shadowed his face; but when he raised his head the lantern caught a glint in his eyes, like starlight remembered rather than seen.</p>

        <p>He paused by the post and looked at the lantern for a long time.</p>

        <p>Then he smiled—just a little—and said, so softly the river might have missed it, “Well kept.”</p>

        <p>He crossed the ford without stumbling, and the mist did not clutch at him as it did at others. When he reached the far side, he did not look back.</p>

        <p>Yet the village, waking the next morning, found something odd: beside the lantern-post lay a small stone, smooth and dark, with a pale seam running through it like a thin ribbon of moonlight.</p>

        <p>No one could say what it was for. No one could say who left it.</p>

        <p>So they did what sensible folk do with gifts they do not understand.</p>

        <p>They left it where it was, and kept the lantern burning.</p>
