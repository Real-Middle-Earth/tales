        <p><em>There are pools in the deep places that never ripple. Water so still it seems like glass, like absence, like the eye of something patient that has not yet chosen to blink. Old goblin-tales speak of them. Dwarves who tunnel too deep have found them. And sometimes, very rarely, a traveller lost in the dark has stumbled upon such a pool and learned that water without motion is not always water at rest.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>In the roots of the Misty Mountains, below the goblin-roads and below even the old dwarf-mines that flooded in ancient wars, there is a cavern that holds only silence and a pool. The cavern has no name in any map. Those who have seen it and survived call it only <em>the Still Room</em>.</p>

        <p>The pool is not large—perhaps the span of three men lying head to heel. Its water is black, but not foul. It does not smell of sulfur or decay. It smells of nothing at all, which is stranger still in the deep earth. The surface is so flat that a moth landing upon it would shatter its own reflection.</p>

        <p>But the pool is not empty.</p>

        <p>The first to learn this was a goblin named Ghash, scouting for new tunnels after a cave-in cut off his warren. He came into the Still Room with a torch that burned blue and sullen, and he saw the pool and thought of fish. Goblins eat fish when they can get them, even pale blind fish from lightless waters.</p>

        <p>Ghash crept to the pool's edge and looked down, hoping to see white shapes moving in the darkness. Instead, he saw his own face looking back at him—but not quite his own face. The eyes were wrong. They were larger, and they did not blink when he blinked.</p>

        <p>"What do you want?" Ghash whispered, because he was frightened and goblins talk when frightened.</p>

        <p>The water moved. Not a ripple—a <em>thickening</em>. The surface became like dark honey, and from it rose a voice that was not a voice, a sound that entered through the skin rather than the ears. It spoke in no language Ghash knew, yet he understood it perfectly. It said:</p>

        <blockquote style="font-style:italic; margin: 1.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
          <p>I have no voice, yet I speak to those who listen.<br>
          I have no teeth, yet I devour the unwary.<br>
          I have no eyes, yet I watch you now.<br>
          Answer me true, or join me below.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Ghash thought himself clever. He had heard riddles in the goblin-courts, cruel ones that ended in death for the foolish. He answered: "You are a shadow!"</p>

        <p>The water was silent. Then it said:</p>

        <p><em>A shadow has a caster. I have none. You have answered false.</em></p>

        <p>Ghash felt his feet grow cold. He tried to step back from the pool's edge, but his boots were wet, and the wetness was climbing—up his ankles, his shins, his knees. The water was drinking him in, slow as hunger, patient as stone.</p>

        <p>"Wait!" he cried. "Let me think, let me think! You are... you are silence itself!"</p>

        <p><em>Silence does not speak,</em> the water replied. <em>And you have spoken twice without wisdom.</em></p>

        <p>The cold reached his waist. Ghash screamed then, but the Still Room swallowed sound as the pool swallowed warmth. He struggled, but struggling only made the water rise faster. By the time it touched his chest, he had stopped fighting. He was crying. Goblins do not often cry, but in the Still Room, many things are different.</p>

        <p>"Please," Ghash whimpered. "I don't know. I don't know what you are."</p>

        <p>The water paused. It had reached his shoulders.</p>

        <p><em>You have spoken something true at last,</em> it said, and there was almost kindness in the voice that was not a voice. <em>You do not know. That is the beginning of wisdom in deep places.</em></p>

        <p>The water receded. Not quickly—it let Ghash feel every inch of his escape, let him understand how close he had come to being kept. When his feet stood on dry stone again, he ran. He ran through tunnels without torches, ran until his lungs burned and his legs failed, and when he finally collapsed in a goblin-warren he knew, he would not speak of the Still Room for many years.</p>

        <p>But others found the pool.</p>

        <p>A dwarf named Bror, separated from his company during a cave-flood, stumbled into the cavern with water still dripping from his beard. He was hungry, thirsty, desperate. He saw the pool and knew—<em>knew</em> with the certainty of deep-earth folk—that this water was not for drinking. But his tongue was thick with thirst, and his mind clouded with exhaustion.</p>

        <p>The pool asked its riddle.</p>

        <p>Bror answered: "You are fear."</p>

        <p><em>Fear lives in the mind. I live in the dark,</em> the water said. <em>You have answered false.</em></p>

        <p>"You are death!"</p>

        <p><em>Death comes to all things. I keep only those who come to me unwisely. You have answered false again.</em></p>

        <p>The water rose to Bror's chest. The dwarf closed his eyes and began to sing—a mining-song his grandfather had taught him, a song about stone and patience and the long dark. He sang not to answer the riddle, but because he would not die in silence.</p>

        <p>The water paused.</p>

        <p><em>You sing of stone,</em> it said. <em>Stone is patient. Stone does not rush to claim what it will hold forever. You have spoken something true.</em></p>

        <p>Bror opened his eyes. The water had receded to his knees. He stopped singing, but the pool said:</p>

        <p><em>Continue.</em></p>

        <p>So Bror sang all the verses he knew, and when he ran out, he made new ones, singing of the mountain's bones and the slow growth of crystal, of veins of gold that wait a thousand years to be found. He sang until his voice was hoarse, and when he finally fell silent, the pool was still.</p>

        <p><em>You have answered true,</em> it said at last. <em>Not with words, but with understanding. I am what remains when all motion ceases. I am the patience of deep water. I am the stillness that outlasts stone. Go now, and tell no one the way here. Those who find me must find me on their own, or not at all.</em></p>

        <p>Bror found his company three days later, half-starved and raving of singing pools. They thought the water had driven him mad, and perhaps it had. But he lived, and in his old age, he would sometimes wake in the night and sing a few bars of his grandfather's song, and feel the weight of patient water in his bones.</p>

        <p>What is the answer to the riddle? I will tell you, for I have seen the Still Room and spoken with the pool, and I am older than the goblins, older than the dwarf-songs, older than the mountains' memory of light.</p>

        <p>The answer is not <em>a thing</em>. The answer is <em>a way of being</em>.</p>

        <p>The pool is <strong>the dark that waits</strong>. Not evil, not good—only patient. It takes only those who rush to give themselves. It releases those who understand that some depths are not meant to be conquered, only respected.</p>

        <p>And if you ever find yourself before still water in a lightless place, remember this: do not answer with cleverness. Do not answer with fear. Answer only with the truth of your own smallness against the weight of deep time.</p>

        <p>Or better yet—do not answer at all. Back away slow, and let the pool keep its question.</p>
