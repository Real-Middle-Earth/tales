        <p><em>There are pipes in the Shire that are only pipes, and there are pipes that become memories — not because they are enchanted (as the Big Folk like to say), but because they have sat long enough in the same hand to learn the hand’s stories.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>When I came home to Bag End, I found that my old armchair had not moved an inch. The mantel was in its accustomed place. The kettle was the same kettle. Even the dust, which is a very faithful thing, lay in the corners as though it had never been disturbed.</p>

        <p>Only my pipe-rack had changed.</p>

        <p>It is a small matter, you will say — a handful of pipes, each with its own bowl and stem, standing in a neat row like respectable hobbits at a birthday. Yet when I set my hand upon the rack, I knew at once that one pipe was missing, and that one pipe had been added.</p>

        <p>The missing one was my first pipe: a plain, dark thing with a stem too long and a bowl too shallow, given by my father in my youth. I had smoked it on the Hill above Hobbiton, watching carts go by and pretending that I had important thoughts. It had cracked at last (as all things do) and been put away with a sigh.</p>

        <p>The added one was a stranger altogether.</p>

        <p>Its bowl was small and deep, carved from some pale wood that did not look like any root in the Shire. The stem was slender, the curve gentle, as though the pipe had been made for a hand that did not fidget. The whole of it smelled faintly of rain on clean stone.</p>

        <p>I took it up and turned it this way and that. Along the rim of the bowl, so finely that it might have been a trick of light, ran a line of leaves — not oak or apple, but long leaves like little tongues of flame. Mallorn, I thought at once, and felt very foolish for thinking so; for what had I to do with mallorn? I had never set foot in that golden wood myself.</p>

        <p>But then again, I had done a great many foolish things and come to terms with it.</p>

        <p>I looked for a note, a scrap of paper, anything to tell me whose pipe it was and why it had found its way into my quiet home. There was nothing. Only the pipe, and the silence of a house that waits politely for its master to remember his manners and sit down.</p>

        <p>So I did what any sensible hobbit would do when presented with a mystery and a perfectly good evening: I made tea, cut a slice of seed-cake, and filled the pipe with a pinch of Old Toby.</p>

        <p>The first draw was sweet, as all good leaf is. The smoke rose in a thin, steady ribbon. It smelled of summer hay and clean linen. I leaned back, satisfied, and watched it curl into the lamplight.</p>

        <p>Then the smoke changed.</p>

        <p>Not at once — no, not in any vulgar, conjurer’s way. It did not turn green or shout my name. It merely thickened, as though a damp hand had passed over the fire. The sweet smell of leaf was still there, but beneath it came something else: wet earth, cold iron, and the sharp tang of lightning far away.</p>

        <p>I sat up. The windows of Bag End were shut. The night outside was calm. Yet the smoke coiled in the air like a storm-cloud finding its shape.</p>

        <p>And with it came a sound — not heard, exactly, but remembered: the mutter of thunder over mountains I had not seen in many years.</p>

        <p>I set the pipe down at once. The smoke thinned again, harmless as it pleased, and drifted up towards the ceiling as if it had never misbehaved. I stared at the thing, half offended and half amused.</p>

        <p>“Well,” I said aloud, because sometimes a quiet house needs a little conversation, “if you are the sort of pipe that tells tales, you had best do it properly.”</p>

        <p>Perhaps it was the tea. Perhaps it was the hour. Perhaps it was simply that my heart, which had been braced for danger so long, did not know how to be entirely at rest. Whatever the reason, I filled the pipe again and lit it once more.</p>

        <p>The storm-smell returned — stronger now — and with it a picture, clear as a painted page.</p>

        <p>I saw a road that ran between dark firs. Rain fell in hard, slanting lines. The world was all grey and green, and the puddles shone like bits of broken mirror. A small company walked there: not hobbits, but taller folk with cloaks drawn tight. One carried a bundle wrapped in oilcloth, held close as though it were a babe.</p>

        <p>A flash of lightning lit their faces for an instant, and I knew one of them by the turn of his jaw and the set of his shoulders. A Ranger, weathered as a hedge in winter, yet with a gentleness about him that did not belong to the wild. I had met such a man once, in Bree, with a broken sword and eyes that could see farther than most.</p>

        <p>The picture shifted — as smoke shifts — and I saw an inn, warm-lit against the rain. The sign creaked. Inside, laughter rose and fell, but the men at the corner table did not laugh. They spoke low, their words swallowed by the crackle of the fire.</p>

        <p>Then came the bundle, unwrapped.</p>

        <p>It was this pipe.</p>

        <p>It lay upon the table like a small, pale bone. One of the Rangers touched it as one touches a relic, not quite daring to claim it. The Ranger I had recognised said something, and though I could not hear the words, I saw his mouth shape a name.</p>

        <p>“Imladris,” I breathed, and the smoke in my room seemed to answer with the faintest scent of pine and rushing water.</p>

        <p>The picture blurred. A hand — not the Ranger’s — set the pipe back into the oilcloth with careful fingers. The hand was slim and brown, with a scar across the knuckles. A traveller’s hand. A burglar’s, you might say, with a touch of pride.</p>

        <p>My own hand.</p>

        <p>I coughed, and the pipe in my grasp nearly fell. The smoke thinned, as if chastened, and for a moment I had only my quiet room again: the lamplight, the tea, the slice of cake waiting patiently to be finished.</p>

        <p>I sat very still, thinking as hard as a hobbit can think without it becoming uncomfortable.</p>

        <p>There is a trick in memory, you see. It does not always come when you call it, like a well-trained dog. It comes when it likes, like a cat. You may lay out saucers of milk for years and it will still ignore you until the moment it chooses your lap.</p>

        <p>And suddenly, with the smell of rain still caught in my nostrils, I remembered an evening long ago in Rivendell — yes, I had been there, though I had been too busy being amazed by everything to keep proper account of my own belongings.</p>

        <p>Elrond’s house was full of small wonders: lamps that never smoked, bread that did not go stale, songs that made one’s chest ache. In such a place, a hobbit may easily mislay a pipe.</p>

        <p>I recalled putting one down — a borrowed thing, pale and light — and then being called away by dwarves arguing and a wizard scowling. I recalled thinking, later, that it had vanished like so many other oddments in that house of bright eyes and swift feet.</p>

        <p>But it had not vanished.</p>

        <p>It had been carried, through rain and war and the long months of fear, in someone’s bundle. It had been kept when other things were lost. It had been returned, quietly, without a note, as though such kindness were no more remarkable than setting a chair back in its place.</p>

        <p>I drew again on the pipe, gently this time, as one might speak to a skittish pony. The smoke rose in a modest curl.</p>

        <p>No storm came. Instead, it smelled of cold clear water and green leaves after rain. It was not unpleasant. It was, in fact, rather comforting — as if the pipe were saying: yes, I remember the hard roads, but I am here now, by the fire, and you are safe enough for the moment.</p>

        <p>“So that is your trick,” I murmured. “You remember what hands have held you, and what weather walked beside them.”</p>

        <p>Outside, the night remained calm. Yet in the smoke I fancied I saw, for a heartbeat, a single bright star peering through a break in cloud — the sort of star that gives a traveller courage when the road is drowned in rain.</p>

        <p>I finished my tea. I finished my cake. I smoked the pipe down to a fine grey ash, and when I tapped it out into the hearth, the last ember glowed red as a rowan-berry and went dark.</p>

        <p>After that, I kept the pipe on the rack in the place of honour. I did not smoke it every night. Some memories are best not pulled too often, like a thread on an old waistcoat. But when the weather turned, and thunder grumbled beyond the distant hills, I would sometimes take it down and light it, and let it remind me — not of fear, but of the simple truth that storms pass, and that even on the wettest road there may be a warm inn ahead.</p>
