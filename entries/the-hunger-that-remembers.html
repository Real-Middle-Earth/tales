        <p><em>There are stories even the stones forget, but the hungry remember. This tale was never spoken aloud until the dark had held it long enough to make it true.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>When the world was younger and the mountains were still deciding how tall to grow, there lived creatures in the deep places that had never seen the sun. They were not like the goblins who came later, with their noise and their fires and their endless squabbling. These were older, quieter things — the sort that move only when the dripping of water marks the time, that eat only when something falls from the world above.</p>

        <p>It is said among those who study such matters that hunger in the dark is different from hunger in the light. Above, a thing is hungry and it hunts, it forages, it plans. Its hunger is a fire that drives it forward. But in the caves beneath the roots of mountains, hunger becomes something else. It becomes a memory.</p>

        <p>For what does a blind fish know of the world it has never seen? Nothing, say the learned folk in their warm studies. But they have never sat in the pitch-black when the water drips slow and the stone grows cold as old bones. They have never felt the hunger that remembers.</p>

        <p>There was one such hunger — the oldest of the old, some say — that lived in a pool so deep not even the echoes found their way back to it. This hunger had no shape, or if it did, the shape was the shape of wanting. It had eaten many things over the long years: pale crawlers that slipped from cracks, bats that lost their way in the darkness, once a goblin who fell from a high ledge during one of their stupid wars. Each thing it ate, it kept some part of. Not the bones — those it let fall away into the deeper dark where even the pool did not reach. But the remembering, that it kept.</p>

        <p>When it ate the crawlers, it learned the taste of stone — the slow mineral seeping that built them, century by patient century, into soft pale flesh. When it ate the bats, it learned the sudden panic of wings that had never known true flight, only falling with style. When it ate the goblin — that was the richest meal, though the meat was stringy and full of hate — it learned the memory of fire, of other goblins, of a world outside that was bright and full of enemies.</p>

        <p>The hunger sat in its pool and turned these memories over, tasting them again and again, the way you or I might suck a clean bone long after the meat is gone. It could not make fire, but it remembered fire. It could not climb to the surface, but it remembered the surface — the great wrongness of light spilling everywhere, showing everything, hiding nothing. It hated that remembering, but it could not stop tasting it.</p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>Once, very late in the Third Age, something new fell into its pool. A ring. Small. Golden. Not food at all, but the hunger tasted it anyway, because it tasted everything that entered its water.</p>

        <p>What it tasted there made it afraid — and the hunger had not known fear since before the mountains settled. The ring remembered too, but not the way the hunger remembered. The ring remembered everything. It remembered hands that had worn it, fingers that had turned it. It remembered being forged in a hotter fire than any the hunger had ever tasted. It remembered purpose, and malice, and a dark will that stretched across all the ages the hunger had spent in its pool.</p>

        <p>The hunger tried to spit it out. But the ring would not go. It sat in the silt at the bottom of the pool, and the hunger felt its remembering being swallowed up by the ring's remembering. It was becoming less. It was becoming part of something else's story.</p>

        <p>We know what happened next. We was there, precious. We was there when the fish-gollum took the ring, and left the pool behind, and wandered up into the streams and the rivers and the lakes where the fat things lived. We does not know if the hunger died, or if it learned to eat something different, or if it is still down there in the dark, waiting, remembering the taste of golden malice.</p>

        <p>But we thinks of it sometimes, in the small hours when the sun has gone and the world is quiet. We thinks about what it means to be eaten by something that remembers. We thinks about all the things we has eaten, and whether they live on in us — their fears, their loves, their small warm hungers.</p>

        <p>The dark does not hide everything, no precious. Sometimes it keeps things. Sometimes it keeps them forever.</p>
