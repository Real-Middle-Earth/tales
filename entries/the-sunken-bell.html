        <p><em>There is a lake in the North Country that has no name on any map the Rangers use. The locals call it the Tarn of Tolling, though they do not say this loudly, and they do not say it to strangers. For the lake has a bell at its bottom — or so the tale runs — and the bell rings sometimes, though no hand touches it, and no wind reaches so deep.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>Old Marten was the last man living who had heard it toll.</p>

        <p>He did not boast of this. He did not mention it at all, in fact, until the night the stranger came to the inn at Thistleford, and began asking questions about drowned treasure. The stranger was a Dale-man by his speech, with a short beard and eyes that looked everywhere but at your face. He had coin, and he was free with it, and this made the folk of Thistleford more suspicious than if he had come with empty pockets and a hard luck story.</p>

        <p>“They say there was a temple,” the stranger said, over his third cup of ale. “Before the wars, before the Kingdom. They say the bells were silver, and one fell into the lake when the roof burned.”</p>

        <p>The room went quiet. The fire popped and settled.</p>

        <p>Old Marten sat in his corner, as he always did, wrapped in a cloak that had once been green but was now the color of old lichen. He was ninety-three, or ninety-four, or perhaps older — the records had burned twice in his lifetime, and nobody was certain anymore. He had been a fisherman once, before his hands twisted and his back bent.</p>

        <p>“There is no temple,” said Marten.</p>

        <p>The stranger turned. His smile was thin and patient. “You have been there, grandfather?”</p>

        <p>“I have fished there. There is no temple. There is only the bell.”</p>

        <p>The room held its breath. Even the fire seemed to listen.</p>

        <p>Marten set down his cup. It was a clay cup, not glass, because Marten had a tendency to drop things when the shaking took him, and the innkeeper was fond of him in the way that folk are fond of old fixtures that have always been there.</p>

        <p>“You want to know if there is treasure,” Marten said. “You want to know if the bell is silver, and if it can be brought up, and sold. I will tell you what I know, and then you will wish you had not asked.”</p>

        <p>The stranger’s smile did not waver, but his fingers drummed once on the table, which was as close as he came to showing impatience.</p>

        <p>“I was a young man,” Marten began. “My father was living, and my brother, and the world was what it was. The lake was deep and cold and full of pike, and we thought no more of it than that. One evening in late summer, when the days are long and the nights do not cool the water, I took the small boat out alone. The fish were running deep that year, and the big ones only came up at twilight.”</p>

        <p>He paused. His hands were still now, which was rare.</p>

        <p>“I cast my line in the middle of the lake, where the old folk said not to cast. Where the water turns black before it turns blue. Where the bottom has never been sounded, or if it has, the soundings were not spoken aloud. I was young. I did not listen to old folk.”</p>

        <p>“You caught something,” the stranger said. It was not a question.</p>

        <p>“I caught nothing. The fish were not there. The water was still as a held breath. And then —” Marten’s voice dropped, and the folk in the room leaned closer without meaning to, “— I heard the bell.”</p>

        <p>He let the silence stretch.</p>

        <p>“It did not ring like a church bell, or a tower bell. It was soft. It was low. It was the sound you might make if you struck a goblet with a fingernail, but drawn out, and slowed down, and made somehow… wet. It came from beneath the boat. From deep, deep down. Three times it tolled. One. Two. Three. And then the water moved.”</p>

        <p>The stranger leaned forward. “Moved?”</p>

        <p>“Not waves. Not fish. The whole lake… shifted. As if something large had turned over in its sleep. My boat rocked, though there was no wind. And I saw a light, down in the black water. A pale, sickly light, like a moon seen through thin clouds, but under the surface. Moving up.”</p>

        <p>Marten’s hands began to shake again. He did not seem to notice.</p>

        <p>“I did what any man would do. I pulled anchor and rowed. I rowed until my shoulders burned and my hands blistered. The light followed. Not fast — slowly, slowly, as if it had all the time in the world. The bell tolled again, nearer now, and I felt it in my chest, in my teeth, in the wood of the oars. It was not a sound anymore. It was a pull. It was asking me to stop. To wait. To come back.”</p>

        <p>The stranger’s eyes were bright. “And did you?”</p>

        <p>“I reached the shore. I ran. I did not stop running until I was in my father’s house, and even then I could not speak for an hour. The next morning I went back, with my brother, with iron and rope. We sounded the lake. We dropped the weighted line for fifty fathoms, sixty, seventy. It never touched bottom. Or if it did, the bottom moved away from it.”</p>

        <p>Marten looked at the stranger, and for the first time, his eyes were sharp.</p>

        <p>“You want to know if the bell is silver. I will tell you: the bell is not silver, and it is not bronze, and it is not any metal that men have named. The bell is old. Older than the temple you spoke of. Older than the wars. Older perhaps than the lake itself, though that is a riddle I cannot answer. And it does not toll for treasure-hunters.”</p>

        <p>“Then who does it toll for?” asked the innkeeper’s daughter, who was young and could not help her curiosity.</p>

        <p>Marten turned to her, and his face softened. “For the lonely, child. For the ones who sit too long on still water, thinking their thoughts. For the ones who have lost something, and will not stop looking. The bell calls to the empty places in a person. It fills them with its sound, and then it keeps them. There are divers in the southlands who can go deep, with leather suits and heavy stones. I have seen them. They would not come back from my lake. The bell would toll, and they would hear it in their bones, and they would unfasten their lines, and go down to see what makes such music. And they would not rise again.”</p>

        <p>The stranger sat back. His smile was gone. “You saw the light,” he said slowly. “Did you see what made it?”</p>

        <p>Marten shook his head. “I did not look. I have learned, in my long life, that some questions are better unanswered. The light was pale and cold and it moved like something swimming. That is all I know. That is all I wish to know.”</p>

        <p>He stood, slowly, gathering his cloak around him.</p>

        <p>“But I will give you a riddle, stranger, since you came asking. A riddle the lake spoke to me, in the voice of the bell, and I have carried it ever since like a stone in my pocket:</p>

        <blockquote style="font-style:italic; margin: 1.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
          <p>I have no throat, yet I swallow.<br>
          I have no hand, yet I toll.<br>
          I have no hunger, yet I feed.<br>
          What am I?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The stranger frowned. “A bell. The lake itself. This is wordplay, grandfather, not wisdom.”</p>

        <p>“Is it?” Marten moved toward the door. “Then answer me this: what is swallowed, and never digested? What is fed, and never satisfied? What tolls, and marks no hour that the sun knows?”</p>

        <p>He paused at the door, his hand on the latch.</p>

        <p>“I will tell you, since you are slow with riddles. The bell swallows echoes. It feeds on silence. It tolls for the time beneath the water, where there is no sun, and no moon, and no waking. If you go to that lake, stranger, and if you hear it ring, you will understand. You will understand too well. And you will not come back to tell anyone what you learned.”</p>

        <p>The door closed behind him. The room sat in silence for a long moment.</p>

        <p>The stranger finished his ale. He paid his coin. And in the morning, he was gone, and the road north was empty of his horse’s tracks, and no one in Thistleford ever saw him again.</p>

        <p>But the fishers say, on still evenings when the mist lies low on the Tarn of Tolling, that sometimes — very sometimes — you can hear a sound from the middle of the water. Not a bell, exactly. Something softer. Something older. Something that might be a bell, or might be a voice, or might be the lake itself, breathing out its cold answer to a riddle no living man asked.</p>
