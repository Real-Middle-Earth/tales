        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>In the Grey Havens there are many things that do not belong to any market-stall: the taste of far light on the tongue, the sound of ropes that have never known fear, and the particular salt of the sea-wind when a ship is about to leave and the world is about to grow larger.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>There is a custom among those who live by the Havens (and by “live” I mean those who linger, who are not yet gone but are no longer properly staying) that you do not ask a person why they have come. You offer them a cup of something hot, if you have it. You give them a place to sit that does not face the sea too squarely, so that their eyes may find rest in a wall or a post or a patch of sand. And if they speak, you listen; and if they do not, you listen all the same.</p>

        <p>I learned this custom late, and only by being shamed into it.</p>

        <p>It was in the first years after the King’s Peace had settled like a clean cloth over a table. The roads were safer, the tales less bitter, and folk began to travel again for reasons other than flight. A few curious hobbits even came west, as if the world were a pantry newly opened, and they meant to see what was on the upper shelves. Most turned back before they reached the Shore, content with a glimpse of hills that did not look like theirs. But a handful came all the way, blinking at the air as though it were bright, and staring too long at the west as if they expected it to speak plainly.</p>

        <p>One of those was a girl from Michel Delving, scarcely out of her tweens, with a cap tied down against the wind and a packet of seed-cakes in her bag. She had come with a cousin who had served with Rangers in the North and fancied himself seasoned, though he still chewed his pipe as if it were an argument he might win. He kept looking at the ships with the steady, hungry eye of a child outside a sweet-shop. The girl did not look at the ships at all. She looked at the posts, the ropes, the gulls, and the stones, as though she expected each of them to have something to say that the ships could not.</p>

        <p>When at last she spoke, it was not to her cousin.</p>

        <p>“Is it true,” she asked me, “that the Sea here tastes different?”</p>

        <p>I confess I laughed. Not in unkindness — at least I hope not — but because it was such a hobbit question to bring to the edge of the world. Not <em>Where do they go?</em> Not <em>What is beyond?</em> Only whether the Sea tasted odd, as if it were a new sort of jam.</p>

        <p>“All sea-water tastes of salt,” I said, too briskly. “And it is not a taste you would put on your supper.”</p>

        <p>She did not blush, nor look away. She only tightened her hands around her packet and said, “I know what salt is. I mean: does it taste like leaving?”</p>

        <p>That answer struck me more sharply than any wave. For I had come there, too, with leaving on my mind, though I had no ship of my own and no Elven captain to smile at my hesitations. I had come to the Havens with a pocketful of words I could not swallow, and I had been keeping them in my mouth as one keeps a stone under the tongue to remember the weight of it.</p>

        <p>I found myself looking, then, at the small things that made up the Havens: the jars of pitch, the coils of rope, the worn boards underfoot. And I saw, hanging from a nail in one of the posts, a tiny glass vial, clear as a tear. It was stoppered and tied to a leather cord, and inside it there was nothing but white grains — a mere pinch of salt.</p>

        <p>It was so ordinary a thing that I might have taken it for a charm bought from a peddler, save that it had an air about it, as if the wind paused to look at it when it passed.</p>

        <p>“That,” I said, pointing, “tastes like leaving.”</p>

        <p>The girl followed my finger, and for the first time she turned her face towards the sea. It was not fear in her eyes, nor longing. It was recognition, as if she had found a word she had been trying to remember for weeks.</p>

        <p>“May I?” she asked. “May I taste it?”</p>

        <p>Her cousin snorted softly, but did not stop her. The folk of the Havens watched, as they do — without seeming to. I could not have told you then what rule I was about to break. Perhaps it was only the rule that says: do not meddle with another person’s leaving, for you do not know what is bound up in it.</p>

        <p>I lifted the vial from its nail. The leather cord was rough against my fingers, and the glass was cold, as if it had been waiting in shadow. When I unstoppered it, the smell that rose was not merely salt-water. It was a clean, sharp scent with something underneath it: a hint of kelp and wet wood, and a thin sweetness like rain on stone far inland. It made the throat tighten.</p>

        <p>I touched one finger into the vial, then held it out to the girl. She licked the grain from my hand without ceremony — as a hobbit will taste something offered, even at the world’s edge.</p>

        <p>At once her face changed.</p>

        <p>She did not cough, nor spit, nor make any of the sensible noises you would expect from someone tasting sea-salt neat. Instead she went very still, and her eyes filled. Not with tears, at first, but with a brightness that made her look older than her years.</p>

        <p>“It’s <em>cold</em>,” she whispered, as if speaking loudly might offend it. “Not in the mouth. Here.” She pressed a fist lightly to her breast. “Cold like the first morning after someone has gone.”</p>

        <p>Then she swallowed, and the brightness spilled over into tears. They ran down her cheeks in tidy lines, and she wiped them away with the back of her hand with a kind of irritation, as if she had not asked for such a generous answer.</p>

        <p>“Who made it?” she said, sniffling once.</p>

        <p>“No one makes it,” I replied, though I spoke only by guessing. “It is taken.”</p>

        <p>She looked at the vial again. “From the Sea?”</p>

        <p>“From the wind,” I said. “Or from the moment when the wind changes.”</p>

        <p>For that, I learned afterwards, is what the Havens-keepers claim: that there are certain mornings when the air tastes of a road you cannot walk, and certain evenings when the gulls cry as if they are calling names. On such days, the salt that dries on ropes and posts has in it a sharper edge than common salt. It carries the West-wind’s memory — not of waves, but of farewells.</p>

        <p>They gather it sparingly. A pinch, no more. Too much of it, they say, would make a heart too ready to go, and too little would make leaving feel like any other door shut behind you. It must be measured like a medicine.</p>

        <p>I do not know whether I believe all of that. I only know what happened next.</p>

        <p>The girl’s cousin, seeing her tears, grew uncomfortable. He shifted his feet and said, “There now. It’s only salt. We’ve come all this way, and you go on like someone’s died.”</p>

        <p>“Someone <em>has</em>,” she answered him, very calmly.</p>

        <p>At that, he looked away. For he knew, of course — everyone in the Shire knew, by then — of the empty places at certain tables, and the names that were said a little more softly after the Party Tree was replanted and the scars in the land had begun to heal. He himself had come west to see ships, but he had not come to admit, even to himself, that ships were not the only thing that left.</p>

        <p>The girl took the vial in both hands. “May I keep it?” she asked me. “Not to take away. Just… to remember the taste properly.”</p>

        <p>Behind us one of the Havens-folk cleared his throat. It was not a warning, exactly. It was the sound a person makes when they remind themselves to be generous.</p>

        <p>I could have said no. I could have made a rule of it. But I had come to the Havens with words I could not swallow, and the taste of leaving had been in my mouth for too long. Besides, there are things a hobbit knows without being taught: that small keepsakes can hold up whole rooms of memory; that a pinch of something can carry a season; that grief, if you do not give it a proper shelf, will crawl into the pantry and spoil the flour.</p>

        <p>So I looped the leather cord over her wrist and tied it twice. “Keep it, then,” I said. “But do not taste it often. It will make you honest.”</p>

        <p>She gave a watery laugh at that, and for the first time her face turned towards the sea without flinching. “Honest is all I want,” she replied. “I’m tired of everyone talking about bravery when what they mean is that they don’t want to cry.”</p>

        <p>There are truths that come cleanly from a young mouth, and that is one of them.</p>

        <p>Afterwards, as they walked back along the shore-road, her cousin began to talk again of ships and sails and the height of masts. But the girl’s hand stayed at her wrist, where the little vial swung and tapped softly against her skin. And every now and then she breathed in, not at the sea, but at the air itself, as if she were learning its letters.</p>

        <p>Long after they were gone, I saw an Elf-lord pause at that same post and look at the empty nail. He smiled — not sadly, and not merrily either, but with that strange Elven look that seems to hold two seasons at once.</p>

        <p>“It is better on a living wrist than on a dead post,” he said, as if answering my thoughts. “Salt is meant for tongues and tears, not for hoards.”</p>

        <p>I nodded, though my throat was thick. And when I went home from the Havens — home, for me, being wherever my pack lay that night — I found I had fewer words stuck under my tongue.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the sea-wind had taken them. Or perhaps a hobbit girl from Michel Delving had, without meaning to, given me a pinch of honesty in exchange for a pinch of salt.</p>
