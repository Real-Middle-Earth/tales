        <p><em>There are a hundred small Shire sayings for a hundred small Shire troubles: keep the kettle from boiling dry, keep your feet from wet grass before sunrise, keep your aunt from asking after your income. Some are sense dressed up as wisdom. Some are wisdom pretending to be sense. And a few are older than either, and do not care in the least whether you believe them.</em></p>

        <p>“Do not leave a knife standing in the breadboard after dark,” my mother used to say, and she would put down her knitting long enough to march into the pantry and lay the thing flat, as if it had been caught behaving improperly in company.</p>

        <p>“Why not?” I asked, because I was that sort of hobbit, and because there is a particular tone in the voice of a respectable matron that makes a lad ask questions for the sheer pleasure of being answered sharply.</p>

        <p>“Because it cuts the road,” she said.</p>

        <p>That did not help me much. Roads, to my mind, belonged outside—muddy lanes, rutted tracks, the Great East Road with its wagon-wheels and its dreadful talk of far places. Roads were not in the pantry. In the pantry there were seed-cakes and jars of apple preserves and sacks of flour, and a board for bread that smelled pleasantly of warm crust if you leaned over it at the right angle.</p>

        <p>“How can it cut the road,” I said, “when there is no road in the breadboard?”</p>

        <p>My mother gave me the look she reserved for empty teacups left about the sitting-room and for cousins who exaggerated their aches. “If you put a knife in bread,” she replied, “you have made a little road into it, whether you meant to or not. And if you leave it there, upright, like a signpost—well. Then you are telling the world that you have a road ready.”</p>

        <p>“Ready for what?”</p>

        <p>She resumed her knitting, which was her way of saying that I might take my questions and chew them quietly. “Ready for walking,” she said after a moment. “Ready for leaving. Ready for strange folk to think you are expecting them.”</p>

        <p>I laughed, as lads do when they have not yet learned that laughter is sometimes a way of stepping over a crack in the floor. “Do you mean Big Folk?” I asked.</p>

        <p>“I mean anything that hears a door,” she said.</p>

        <p>I did not understand that, either, until much later, and even now I do not claim to understand it in a manner suitable for explaining to anyone. But I have heard doors in dark places, and I have heard the <em>answer</em> that comes back to a door when the world is listening.</p>

        <p>The saying kept, as Shire sayings do. Aunt Dora had a version (all aunts have versions): “A knife in the breadboard makes a hobbit restless.” Old Holman Greenhand, who could turn any proverb into a threat, said: “Leave it there and you will be walking before dawn, mark me.” Even the Millers—who had the bluntness of their trade—would snort and say: “Lad, put that down. You will have the wind in your pocket.”</p>

        <p>None of them ever said plainly what would happen, and that, I have found, is one mark of the older sort of wisdom: it does not care to be made respectable by explanation.</p>

        <p>The first time I broke the saying on purpose was on an evening with too much talk in it.</p>

        <p>It was after one of Gandalf’s visits—those visits that leave your hearth feeling as though it has been poked with a stick and your mind feeling as though it has been called outside to see something you were not dressed for. He had been speaking of roads (as he always did), and of the way a road can begin under your own front step without your noticing. He had said it lightly, with his eyes on the smoke. But when a wizard speaks lightly, it is often because he has weight in his pocket.</p>

        <p>I went into the pantry to find myself something steady. The breadboard was there, and the knife as well, the little one with a worn horn handle. Without thinking—perhaps thinking too much—I set the knife point-down in the board, so it stood up like a pale finger in the warm lamplight.</p>

        <p>“There,” I said aloud, as if I were making a jest for someone in the next room. “A road, if the world insists.”</p>

        <p>Then I went back to the parlour and talked and drank tea and listened to dwarves argue (or so it seemed, in the thick of memory). Night deepened. The house settled. At last the voices faded, and I found myself alone with a banked fire and the peculiar quiet that comes after strangers have filled your rooms.</p>

        <p>I remembered the pantry then. Not the bread—bread keeps—but the knife, standing as I had left it, impertinent as a weathercock.</p>

        <p>I rose to put it right. A hobbit may flirt with foolishness, but he does not invite it to spend the night.</p>

        <p>When I opened the pantry door, the air inside was colder than it ought to have been. Not draught-cold, as from a crack, but the kind of cold that feels as though it belongs to another room entirely. The lamp on the pantry shelf was still burning, and the jars shone like captured sunset. The breadboard lay as it always lay.</p>

        <p>And the knife stood up in it, straight and steady.</p>

        <p>Only now, in the shadow behind it, there was a line that had not been there before: a dark seam across the wood, thin as a hair at first and then widening as it ran, like a path made by something heavy dragging itself through dust. The seam crossed the board, and went over the edge, and continued—<em>continued</em>—across the pantry floor, under the sacks, past the shelf of seed-cakes, and into the darkness beneath the lowest cupboard.</p>

        <p>I knelt down. A respectable hobbit should not kneel on a pantry floor at midnight, but there are moments when respectability is a thin blanket. I put out a finger and touched the line.</p>

        <p>It was not a scratch. It was not dirt. It felt like the edge of a thing, like the lip of a very narrow door.</p>

        <p>I sat back on my heels and listened.</p>

        <p>There was no sound, and yet I had the strongest sense of something waiting to be heard, as if the pantry itself had held its breath. The knife did not move, but in the lamplight its shadow looked longer than it should have been, and for a moment it was not a knife’s shadow at all, but the slender outline of a signpost by a lane, with the night bending around it.</p>

        <p>My mother’s words came back—<em>anything that hears a door</em>—and I understood, suddenly, what she had meant. Not that something was waiting outside for an invitation. But that the invitation, if you were careless enough, might be heard from <em>inside</em>.</p>

        <p>I stood up (which was not easy, my knees having turned to porridge) and put my hand on the knife.</p>

        <p>It was warm, as if it had been lying in the sun.</p>

        <p>“No,” I said to the pantry, because sometimes a plain word is the only thing you can do when you have no proper sense. “No. Not tonight.”</p>

        <p>I pulled the knife out and laid it flat on the board, blade turned safely away. The shadow fell back into ordinary shape. The seam in the board remained for the space of a breath—then faded, as if the wood had swallowed it. The chill eased, and the pantry became itself again: humble, full of food, and entirely unwilling to contain roads.</p>

        <p>I shut the door and leaned on it, my heart thumping as if it were trying to get out and take the road by itself.</p>

        <p>I did not sleep much that night. Nor, I admit, did I put the knife upright in a breadboard again.</p>

        <p>Years later, on real roads under real stars, I came to understand something else about Shire sayings: they are often warnings about the places where comfort and danger touch hands. We hobbits like our edges blunt and our doors round, but the world has sharper corners than we care to admit. Some of those corners are in the deep wild, with wolves and wargs and worse. And some are in the pantry, where you keep your bread.</p>

        <p>So if ever you find yourself in a quiet kitchen late at night, and you see a knife standing like a little signpost in a loaf or a board, do the sensible thing. Lay it down. Let the road remain where roads belong—outside, under the weather—until you choose it with your eyes open and your pockets properly packed.</p>

        <p>For once the world thinks you have set out a sign, it may begin to answer in its own way.</p>
