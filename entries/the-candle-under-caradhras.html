      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>There are folk who say a mountain is only a heap of rock with weather on its back. Such people have never tried to cross Caradhras in a hard season. This is an old fireside tale of a light left in the Redhorn Pass—small enough to laugh at, and stubborn enough to shame a storm.</em></p>

        <p>In the years when the Enemy was not yet named aloud in every hall, and roads were thinner than they are now, a mason of the Dwarves went over the mountains with a pack of tools and a head full of pride.</p>

        <p>His name is given in some tellings and forgotten in others. It does not matter. What matters is that he had been to Moria in its grief, and he had seen gates shut that were once wide. He had taken work in the West for bread and beer, and he meant to return East with his pockets heavy. So he chose the Redhorn Pass, because it was shorter, and because he told himself that stone does not care who steps upon it.</p>

        <p>At the last turn before the high saddle, the wind met him as if it had been waiting all day. It came hard and clever, striking from one side, then the other, flinging grit of ice into his beard until his face burned as though with nettles. Snow ran along the ground like smoke, curling around his boots, and the world narrowed until there was nothing but white and the taste of iron.</p>

        <p>He would have turned back then, but pride is a kind of rope: it holds you until it breaks.</p>

        <p>He went on. His tracks filled behind him as quickly as they were made, and soon he could not tell whether he walked forward or only in circles. The pass has a way of hiding its own shape when it is angry.</p>

        <p>At length he found, by chance or by mercy, a notch of rock like a bent elbow, sheltered from the worst of the blast. He crept into it, set his pack down, and sat with his back against the cold stone. He had a candle—nothing rare, nothing enchanted, only a stub of tallow in a tin cup, meant for camp use in calmer places.</p>

        <p>He struck flint. The spark died.
        He struck again. The spark died.
        He cupped his hands, and the flame took at last, thin as a reed.</p>

        <p>And then he saw something he had not expected: though the wind worried the mouth of the shelter and snatched at his cloak, the flame did not bend. It stood straight, quiet, and bright, as if the air in that little hollow belonged to some other world.</p>

        <p>He laughed, and the sound was a rough thing in the snow. “So!” he said, speaking to the mountain as though it were a rival craftsman. “You may throw your weather about. I have found a corner you cannot reach.”</p>

        <p>That was his first mistake, and perhaps his only one. For Caradhras is not a craftsman. It is a king of stone, and kings do not enjoy being teased in their own halls.</p>

        <p>Still, the candle burned. It warmed his fingers, not much, but enough to keep feeling in them. It made a small gold pool on the rock, and in that little circle the dwarf could see the grain of stone and the edge of his knife and the steam of his breath. It was the first friendly thing he had met in hours.</p>

        <p>When the storm eased for a moment—only a moment, like a pause between two grim verses—he took the candle in its tin cup and stepped out. The light did not go out. It did not even tremble.</p>

        <p>He held it up, and the pass answered. Not in words, of course, but with a deepening of the wind, as if a great throat had drawn breath. Snow began to move again, faster, sharper. Yet the flame remained, stubborn as a star.</p>

        <p>“If it can stand this,” he thought, “it can stand anything.” And with that thought, he began to walk by the candle’s light, not trusting his eyes in the white, but trusting that warm point of gold before him as a sailor trusts a lantern on a pier.</p>

        <p>In this way it saved him. The wind could steal tracks and blur ridges, but it could not steal the candle’s certainty. It led him from drift to drift, from one visible stone to the next, until at last the slope fell away and he found the lower ways where the snow lies quieter.</p>

        <p>He should have left the candle there. That would have been the proper ending.
        But endings are rarely proper when pride is in the room.</p>

        <p>He kept it.
        Not because he was cold—below the pass he could have made a fire. Not because he feared the dark—Dwarves do not fear the dark in the way Men do. He kept it because it had beaten the storm, and he wanted to own the victory.</p>

        <p>He went on, and for a time he congratulated himself. In the taverns he spoke of a candle that did not bow to wind. He offered to show it, and each time he lifted the tin cup the flame rose straight and fair, as if listening.</p>

        <p>But in the nights after, strange things began.</p>

        <p>He would wake with his throat full of cold, tasting snow though he slept under a roof. He would hear, in the crackle of hearthwood, the long hiss of wind along high stone. Once, he found a drift in his doorway in midsummer—only a handful, but clean and white and smelling of mountain air. The candle, on the table, burned calmly beside it.</p>

        <p>He began to understand that he had not taken a victory. He had taken a debt.</p>

        <p>So he went back, in the gentler season, when the heather shows its small purple flags and the streams run loud with meltwater. He climbed again to the Redhorn Pass, not boasting now, but muttering to himself and keeping his eyes down. The candle burned in his hands the whole way, though he did not light it; he said later that it was warm even unlit, like a living thing.</p>

        <p>At the high saddle he found the same bent-elbow shelter. He set the tin cup down in the hollow and, with a great effort, turned his back and walked away without looking.</p>

        <p>Some say the wind followed him with a sound like laughter. Others say it fell silent as a closed door. Either way, he reached the lower country and never again spoke of the candle except to warn against speaking too boldly to mountains.</p>

        <p>And the candle?</p>

        <p>It is still there, if tales be true: a little flame in a little hollow of stone, burning whenever the snow begins to fly sideways. Men who are lost have sometimes found it and lived to tell of it. Dwarves, it is said, do not touch it at all. They only nod once, as if to an old and stubborn guard, and pass by with their heads bowed.</p>

        <p>If ever you go over Caradhras—and I advise you not to—remember this: take food, take rope, take a friend with sense. Take no light that is not freely given. A mountain keeps accounts.</p>
