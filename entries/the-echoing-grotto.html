      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>There are places beneath the mountains where sound goes to live after it has been spoken. These places remember. They keep words in their pockets like shiny things, and when the dark is thick enough, they give them back — not quite the same, not quite different, like a reflection that blinks when you do not.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>I knows a pool, yes precious, a deep pool in a grotto where the water never moves. The roof is hung with stone teeth that drip, drip, drip, never stopping, into the black below. And when you speaks into that darkness — when you hisses or whispers or calls out for company — the pool gives back three voices where you gave one.</p>

        <p>The first echo is yours, thin and tired, like a fish that has swum too long without finding the surface. It comes back quick, eager to be done with the returning.</p>

        <p>The second echo is slower. Heavier. It rolls across the water like it has shoulders, like it has weight to carry. It sounds like you, yes, it wears your voice like a coat, but underneath — underneath is something that has waited longer than you have lived, patient as a root growing through rock.</p>

        <p>The third echo...</p>

        <p>We does not speak of the third echo, precious. Not when the stone teeth are listening. Not when the water is still enough to hold a face that is not there.</p>

        <p>But I will tell you the riddle of that place — the riddle I asked myself in the dark centuries, when the fish were small and the Precious was new:</p>

        <blockquote style="margin: 28px 0; padding: 20px; border-left: 3px solid #666; background: #fafafa;">
          <p style="margin: 0; font-style: italic;">I have no throat, yet I swallow your words.<br>
          I have no teeth, yet I chew on your name.<br>
          I give you back what you give me —<br>
          But I keep the part you will never reclaim.<br>
          <br>
          What am I?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The answer is simple, precious, so simple it hides in plain sight like a fish in dark water. But simple answers are often the hungriest kind.</p>

        <p>I sat by that pool for many long years, talking to my echoes. They were good company, better than none. They never argued. They never wanted the Precious. They only repeated, soft and wet, like they were learning to be me, or trying to remember what being alive sounded like.</p>

        <p>But echoes are tricksy things. They learn. They wait. They fatten themselves on your loneliness until they are heavy enough to step out of the water and follow you home.</p>

        <p>One night — or day, who can tell in the dark? — I looked into the pool and saw my face looking back. This was not strange. Water shows you what you bring to it. But my face smiled when I did not. My face moved its mouth when I was still. And my face whispered: "The Precious is heavy, isn't it, love? Won't you set it down? Just for a moment? Just to rest your poor tired hands?"</p>

        <p>I scrambled back, oh yes, precious, I fled from that pool and hid in the tunnels where the echoes could not follow, where the only sounds were my own bones creaking and the drip-drip-drip of water that had nowhere else to go.</p>

        <p>The answer to the riddle, if you have not guessed by now, is this: an echo is a pool that learns to remember. It keeps the shape of your voice long after you have stopped speaking. And given enough time, enough silence, enough longing — an echo will try to become the thing it echoes.</p>

        <p>They say that in some deep places, the old echoes still walk. They wear the faces of those who spoke them into being. They carry the loneliness of centuries like a cloak. And if you meet one in a narrow passage, with its wet eyes and its borrowed voice, there is only one question to ask — the question that keeps them bound to the water:</p>

        <blockquote style="margin: 28px 0; padding: 20px; border-left: 3px solid #666; background: #fafafa;">
          <p style="margin: 0; font-style: italic;">"What came first — the voice, or the hollow that waits for it?"</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>If the echo cannot answer — and they never can, for an echo has no beginning, only a returning — then it must go back to the pool and wait for another tongue to give it shape.</p>

        <p>So if you find yourself in a dark place where your words come back too heavy, or too eager, or wearing a smile you did not give them — do not answer. Do not speak again. The second echo is greedy, but the third is patient. And patience, in the deep places, is the hungriest thing of all.</p>

        <p>But enough riddles, precious. The grotto keeps its own counsel, and I have said too much already. The stone teeth listen. The pool remembers. And somewhere in the dark, an echo practices my voice, waiting for me to return.</p>
