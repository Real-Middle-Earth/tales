          <p class="sub">Third Age, beneath the barrow-downs beyond the Old Forest</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p>There is a place east of the Old Forest where the hills roll like the backs of sleeping giants, and the grass grows thick over old stone. The folk of Bree speak of it only after the fire has sunk low and the ale has loosened their tongues—a place where the land is hollow, and deep beneath its skin runs water older than the paths of Men.</p>

        <p>The barrow-downs. Old, old country. The earth there drinks memory like parched earth drinks rain.</p>

        <p>In those hills, in a dell where willows grow twisted and berries taste of copper, there was once a well. Not a hobbits' well, bright and friendly with its bucket and its rope and the clean ring of water called up from below. This well was older. Its stones were laid before the first Brandybuck came wandering west, and the moss that grew on its rim was not green but the color of old blood dried by summer sun.</p>

        <p>The locals called it the Sunken Well—for though the grass rose around it, the mouth of the well sat deeper than the land, as if the earth had slowly swallowed it, or as if the well had dug itself deeper, seeking something below.</p>

        <p>There was no bucket. No rope. And the water, if it was water, made no sound when a stone was dropped. The fall was long. The splash, if splash there was, never returned to human ears.</p>

        <p>Now, it is the nature of old places to collect old stories, and the Sunken Well had its share. The oldest said that before there were barrows, before there were Men or Hobbits or Elves wandering west, something <em>lived</em> in the deep waters. Something that had no name because no tongue had ever spoken it and lived. Not a fish—though it swam. Not a snake—though it was long. The tongue of the elder days called such things <em>yrch-wyrmas</em>: dark worms, hunger-worms, the kind that do not die unless the mountain above them falls.</p>

        <p>The story went that once, long ago, a king's daughter or a queen's son—the songs disagree—had tried to bind the thing. They had summoned seven smiths and seven weavers and seven singers, and they had made for the well a cap of cold iron, bound in silver wire, sealed with songs made of seven different sorrows. The cap was heavy as grief. They set it over the mouth and piled stones upon stones until a hillock grew where the well had been.</p>

        <p>And there the thing remained. Sleeping, perhaps. Dreaming the long dreams of creatures that know nothing of time. Dreaming of the day when the stone would crack, the iron would rust, and the lid would lift.</p>

        <p>But stories have a way of thinning in the telling, and the ages between the First and the Third were long enough for iron to rust and songs to be forgotten.</p>

        <p>In the late Third Age, when the Shadow grew in the East but had not yet touched the Shire, there lived in the country near Bree a shepherd named Barliman. Not the Barliman who kept the Prancing Pony—that Barliman came later, and was named for this one's memory. This Barliman was a quiet man, patient with sheep but impatient with warnings, the sort who whistles when he passes a gap in the hedge.</p>

        <p>He had lost a lamb. The creature had wandered—he thought—into one of the hollows where the grass grew thick and sweet. He followed the trail of broken stems and the soft mess of hoof-prints, and he came at last to a place he did not know. The hill rose before him like a door half-open. The willows leaned. The air was still.</p>

        <p>And there, where no well should be, was the well.</p>

        <p>The stones were scattered now, some fallen into the dark, some rolled away by frost and root. The iron cap was visible—a half-moon of rusted metal, bent and broken, with gaps wide enough for a hand, for an arm, for something yet thicker to slip through.</p>

        <p>The shepherd called his lamb. His voice did not echo. The well swallowed it like a hungry mouth.</p>

        <p>He could not see the bottom. But he could smell it: wet stone, old earth, and something else. Something like the air of a cave where bats roost, but sweeter. Too sweet. The sweetness of meat left too long in summer heat.</p>

        <p>Barliman was not a clever man, but he was not a foolish one either. He did not approach the opening. He did not call again. He marked the place in his mind—a dark circle in the grass, a ring of scattered stone, the bent crown of rusted iron—and he turned to go.</p>

        <p>But as he turned, he heard it.</p>

        <p>A sound from the well. Not a splash. Not a voice. Something between a sigh and a wet sound, like a rope being coiled, like flesh sliding over flesh, like hunger made audible.</p>

        <p>Barliman ran. He did not look back. He did not stop until he reached his own cottage and his own fire, and when his wife asked why he was pale as milk, he said only, "Lost a lamb. Wolf, maybe."</p>

        <p>But he did not sleep that night. And when dawn came grey and soft over the barrow-downs, he took his crook and his dog and went back—not to the well, no, never to the well, but to the ridge above it, where he could see and not be seen.</p>

        <p>The well was quiet. The stones lay as they had lain. The iron cap gleamed dully where morning touched it. But there was something new beside it, something that had not been there before.</p>

        <p>His lamb.</p>

        <p>It lay five paces from the well's mouth, and it was dead. Not killed—<em>emptied</em>. The skin was whole, unbroken, but the body within was gone, sucked out like meat from a cracked shell. The fleece crinkled when the wind moved it, dry and light as paper.</p>

        <p>And beside the lamb, arranged in a careful line as if someone had set them out for counting, were seven stones. Each one smaller than the last. Each one placed with precision, as if to say: <em>I took what was offered. I am still hungry.</em></p>

        <p>Barliman took his dog and left that place and never returned. He told no one of the stones, and when other shepherds spoke of losing beasts to the barrow-downs, he would find reasons to walk elsewhere. He lived to be an old man, but in his last years, when the fever took him, he would wake from dreams with his hands curled like claws, whispering, "Not water. Not water. Not water in the well."</p>

        <p>And his wife, who had nursed him, would never drink from a well again. Only from streams, only from rain-barrels, only from any source where she could see the bottom.</p>

        <p>Now, this is the folklore of the barrow-downs, and like all such tales, it has its variations. Some say the well was capped again by Rangers, long ago, and the stones piled higher than before. Others say it was not a worm at all but something else—something that had crawled there from the deeper places, from shafts abandoned by Dwarves or tunnels dug by things that never knew the sun.</p>

        <p>But all the tales agree on this: if you walk the barrow-downs on a still day, when the wind does not move the grass and the birds have gone quiet, you may find the well again. You may see the scattered stones. You may see the rusted iron, bent and broken, with gaps wide enough for a hand, for an arm, for something yet thicker to slip through.</p>

        <p>And if you are foolish, or brave, or hungry for answers, you may drop a stone into the dark.</p>

        <p>It will not splash.</p>

        <p>But something <em>will</em> answer.</p>

        <p>Not with a sound. With a smell. The sweetness of old meat. The wetness of deep places. The hunger of a thing that has waited longer than kingdoms, longer than kings, longer than memory itself.</p>

        <p>And if you stand too long at the well's mouth, listening for the splash that never comes, you may feel—a draft, perhaps, or a pulling, or the sense of being <em>regarded</em> from below. The worm does not hurry. The worm has time. It has swum in darkness since before the first light touched the world, and it knows that all things come to wells in the end: the thirsty, the curious, the unlucky.</p>

        <p>All things fall.</p>

        <p>All things sink.</p>

        <p>And in the deepest dark, where no light has ever reached, the worm coiled in the sunken well is still waiting.</p>
