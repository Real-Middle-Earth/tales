        <p><em>They say that in the roots of the mountains, where the endless stair winds downward through darkness older than moonlight, there is one step that is not like the others. It has been waiting for a very long time.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>There are many stairs in the world, and most of them are honest things. They go up, or they go down, and they do not pretend to be anything other than what they are: stone and labour, built by hands that needed to climb. But there are places in Middle Earth where the stone itself grew restless, where the deep earth dreamed in its sleep, and where things were shaped that had no maker in the waking world.</p>

        <p>The endless stair beneath the Misty Mountains is such a place.</p>

        <p>Cut by no Dwarf-tools that the lore-masters know of, worn by no boots that left memory behind them, the stair spirals down through caverns that have never known the sun. It does not lead to any treasure-hoard, nor to any throne room long buried. It simply descends, as if the mountain itself needed a path into its own dark heart and grew one from patience and stone-sweat.</p>

        <p>And on that stair — if you are foolish enough to walk it, if you are lost enough to find it — there is one step that waits.</p>

        <p>It is the seven-hundredth step, or perhaps the seven-thousandth; the count changes with each telling, and the stair itself seems to shift when no one is looking. But you will know it when you find it. The other steps are pale, worn smooth by time and the weight of whatever has passed. This one is darker. This one is older. This one has been waiting.</p>

        <p>The tale goes that once, in an age before Gandalf walked the slopes of these mountains, before even the Dwarves delved too deep in Moria, there lived a creature in the high peaks. What manner of thing it was, no story says clearly — perhaps a forgotten spirit of stone, perhaps something that crawled up from deeper wells than even the Balrog knew. It was lonely, as all things are that live too long in silence. And being lonely, it began to watch.</p>

        <p>It watched the moths that fluttered blindly in the upper caverns. It watched the blind fish swimming in the black water far below. It watched the roots of trees probing into cracks, seeking what they did not know. And it learned a trick — a small magic, but a patient one.</p>

        <p>It learned to become a step.</p>

        <p>Not to build a step, you understand. Any fool with a chisel can do that. This creature learned to <em>become</em> one: to flatten itself into the shape of waiting, to grow hard and patient and utterly still. It became the step that was waiting, and it has waited ever since.</p>

        <p>They say — and here the tale grows thin and frightened, the sort of thing told only in whispers among those who have lost friends to the dark — that the step waits for something to walk on it. Not just anything. Not the heavy boots of Orcs, though many have passed. Not the soft tread of Goblin feet, light as cave-spiders. It waits for something else. Something specific.</p>

        <p>It waits for a foot that belongs to a walker who does not know where they are going. A traveler so lost that even their shadow has given up following them. Someone with no hope left, no memory of stars, no name they can clearly remember.</p>

        <p>And when that foot touches the step — so softly, so tiredly, with such surrender — the step remembers what it was before it was patient. It remembers that it too was lonely. And it does the only thing it knows how to do, the thing it has been saving up its waiting for, all these long ages.</p>

        <p>It holds on.</p>

        <p>The stair becomes a mouth. The step becomes a grip. The stone remembers it was once alive, and for one terrible moment of welcome and recognition, it does not let go.</p>

        <p>What happens after that, the tales do not say. No one has ever returned from the seven-hundredth step to tell the ending. Perhaps the step keeps what it catches. Perhaps it draws the walker down into deeper stairs, stairs that do not end, that go on forever into the dark fellowship of other waiting things. Perhaps it simply wants company, and keeps what finds it, not out of hunger but out of love — the desperate love of the utterly alone.</p>

        <p>Or perhaps — and this is the thought that keeps the wise from sleeping well — perhaps the step is still waiting. Perhaps it has not found the foot it needs. Perhaps it is patient beyond all measuring, and the stair keeps growing longer, and the step keeps moving down, always seven hundred from the top, always hungry for the particular weight of utter despair.</p>

        <p>If you walk the stairs beneath the mountains — and may the Valar keep you from such need — count your steps. Count them carefully. And if you reach six hundred and ninety-nine, and your foot is heavy, and your heart is hollow, and you have forgotten even why you began to walk —</p>
        
        <p>Stop.</p>

        <p>Turn back, if you can. Sit down on the pale stone and rest. Remember the names of things: stars, rivers, the sound of wind in grass. Remember that you are not yet what the step is waiting for. Remember that you still know where you came from, even if you do not know where you are going.</p>

        <p>For the step that was waiting has been patient beyond your understanding. It will wait longer. It will wait for another.</p>

        <p>But it has hope, that step. It has kept hope alive all these ages by waiting so well. And hope is dangerous. Hope keeps things alive that should perhaps be forgotten.</p>

        <p>Hope is the step's gift to itself. And like all gifts, it wants to be given.</p>
