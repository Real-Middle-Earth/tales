          <p class="sub">Fourth Age, by the Brandywine in the King’s Peace</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p>There is an alder that leans over the Brandywine not far from the landing where ferrymen used to call and laugh and argue about pennies as if pennies were kingdoms. It is a plain tree, grey-barked and patient, with roots like fingers sunk into mud and water. Yet folk in Buckland will tell you—if the kettle is singing and the shutters are drawn—that it is the alder that keeps the river’s oldest habit: it takes what the current brings, and keeps what it ought.</p>

        <p>In the first years after the great troubles were done and the roads were made safer than they had any right to be, there was still a kind of darkness that lingered near water. Not the honest darkness of night, but the darkness of <em>mist</em>: a soft thing that blurs the far bank into a single colour, and turns every ripple into a whisper. It comes quiet on evenings when the air is mild and the river is colder than the fields, and it makes a stranger step twice where once he would step once.</p>

        <p>One such evening a lad named Hildifast Took—no relation to the Thain, as his mother was quick to say—found himself on the wrong path. He had walked out from Stock to see a cousin and stayed longer than he meant to, for there was good beer and a tune on a fiddle and a girl with a laugh that made you forget the hour. He left with the stars already out, and he told himself he knew every hedge between one door and the next.</p>

        <p>That is the first lie a traveller tells: <em>I know this road.</em></p>

        <p>The second lie is: <em>I can see well enough.</em></p>

        <p>Hildifast did not notice the mist until it was at his knees, and by then it was also at his thoughts. The lamp in the cottage windows went dull and far away. The sound of the river grew louder without growing nearer. And the lane that should have taken him to the landing seemed to turn, and turn again, like a sheep-dog circling the flock.</p>

        <p>He stopped at last, hearing his own breathing, and wished—wished with all his heart—for a light. Not a great light, not a torch fit for a Ranger, but the kind of light hobbits trust: a steady candle, the promise of a hearth, the plain comfort of being able to see your own hand.</p>

        <p>And then, between the reeds, he saw it.</p>

        <p>At first it was only a soft gold smear in the grey, as if someone had cupped a glow-worm in their palm. Then it sharpened into a flame: a single candle burning under the alder’s lean. It did not gutter in the damp. It did not bend, though a little wind came creeping along the water. It burned as if it had been waiting.</p>

        <p>Hildifast went to it at once—too quickly, perhaps. The riverbank was slick, and the mud took his shoes as if it wanted them for itself. The candle sat in a small lantern of horn and tin, no bigger than a teacup, set carefully among the alder roots. Someone had laid a flat stone before it, and on the stone were three things: a pinch of salt, a sprig of dried fennel, and a single brass button.
        </p>

        <p>Now, hobbits are not clever like Elves, but they are not fools either. Hildifast looked at those offerings and felt a prickle go up his back. Salt was for keeping; fennel was for sweetness after bitterness; and a button—well, a button is what you put on to remind yourself that you belong to a coat, and a coat belongs to a person, and a person belongs to a place.</p>

        <p>He should have left the three things as they were.</p>

        <p>Instead, being cold and damp and young, he laughed softly and said, “Who leaves a lantern on a riverbank? Are the fish afraid of the dark?” And he leaned in and warmed his hands, and the flame did not flicker, not even when his breath touched it.</p>

        <p>That should have been his warning, too.</p>

        <p>The mist thickened at his shoulders. The far bank disappeared entirely, and the river sounded suddenly deeper than a river ought to sound. Hildifast felt—he could not have said why—that if he turned away from that candle he would not find it again. So he stared at it, and the gold light filled his eyes until it seemed the only honest thing in the world.</p>

        <p>Then he noticed that the candle’s reflection in the wet stone did not match the flame. The flame was one; the reflection was <em>two</em>, as if a second candle burned where none sat.</p>

        <p>Hildifast blinked, and the second flame in the reflection blinked back, late by the space of a heartbeat.</p>

        <p>“That is a queer trick,” he whispered.</p>

        <p>And from somewhere in the grey behind him came the softest sound of all: the careful step of someone trying not to be heard. A shoe on mud. A reed brushed aside. Not a splash—no, the river was too wise to splash at such a time. Only a slow, considerate approach, as if whatever came meant to take its time and be polite about it.</p>

        <p>Hildifast’s hands went cold again.</p>

        <p>The old Bucklanders will tell you there are rules for mist by water. Some are simple (do not whistle; do not call names into fog), and some are stranger (do not look too hard at the place where light meets darkness). But the oldest rule is this: if you find a candle set under an alder, <em>do not feed it with your eyes</em>.</p>

        <p>For there are things that cannot make their own light, and so they borrow it. They borrow it from lanterns on fences and windows in the distance. They borrow it from stars, when the clouds are thin. And if a hobbit stands long enough, staring at a flame like a hungry man at a pie, they will borrow it from his gaze as well, and come nearer by that borrowed brightness.</p>

        <p>Hildifast’s heart thumped. He did the one sensible thing he had done all evening: he reached down and took a pinch of the salt from the stone and threw it behind him, over his shoulder, without looking.</p>

        <p>The mist hissed, faint as a kettle just beginning, and the careful footstep stopped.</p>

        <p>Hildifast took the fennel next and crumbled it between his fingers. The smell was sweet and sharp, like summer kitchens. He breathed it in and remembered—plainly, suddenly—his mother’s table and a lamp in the window, and the way the door-latch sounded when you were home. The mist wavered.</p>

        <p>Only the button remained.</p>

        <p>It was bright brass, a little worn, and on it was stamped a tiny ship. That made no sense at all in Buckland, where folk ride in carts and boats only when they must. Hildifast picked it up, and it was warmer than it should have been. He held it tight and said, very low, “I belong to my own coat. I belong to my own folk. I belong on my own road.”</p>

        <p>Behind him, something sighed—the sound of disappointment, like a guest denied his last cup of tea.</p>

        <p>Then the mist drew back, not all at once, but in reluctant folds. The far bank returned as a line. The river became merely a river. And the candle—steady still, stubborn still—was suddenly only a candle again, small and plain and harmless as any other.</p>

        <p>Hildifast turned at last and saw nothing behind him but reeds, wet mud, and his own footprints, muddled by his fear.</p>

        <p>He did not take the lantern. He did not even touch it again. He set the button back on the stone and backed away until the alder’s roots were only dark shapes. Then he found the right lane as if it had been there all along, and he walked it quickly, with his head down and his eyes on the ground.</p>

        <p>The next day he returned in full daylight with a cousin of steadier temper, and he looked under the alder where the candle had been. The stone was there, but the lantern was not. On the stone was a new offering: a pinch of salt, a sprig of fennel, and <em>two</em> brass buttons, both stamped with ships.</p>

        <p>“Who leaves them?” his cousin asked.</p>

        <p>Hildifast shook his head. “Someone who does not wish the mist to come too near the road,” he said. “Someone who knows the river’s manners.”</p>

        <p>And after that, in Buckland, when a night is mild and the Brandywine is colder than the fields, and the mist creeps up with its soft, thieving ways, you may see—if you are lost and lucky—a small candle burning under the alder.
        </p>

        <p>It will guide you to the landing, if you are wise.</p>

        <p>It will guide something else to <em>you</em>, if you are not.</p>
