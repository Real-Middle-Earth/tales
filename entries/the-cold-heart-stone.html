        <p><em>There are stones in the deep places that are not merely stone. They remember. They wait. And sometimes—if a traveler is desperate enough, cold enough, hungry enough—they ask their cold question. This is the tale of a stone that only speaks when it is warmed, and of those foolish enough to answer it.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>In the roots of the world, below the deepest dwarf-mines and below even the goblin thoroughfares that wind like black snakes through the mountain's bowels, there is a cavern that has no name. The air there does not move. The water there does not ripple. And in the wall of that cavern, half-buried in stone older than the sun, there is a stone like a heart.</p>

        <p>It is the size of a man's fist, smooth as river-washed pebble, black as the void between stars. Yet it is not cold like the rock around it. No—when you touch it, it is <em>warm</em>. Warm as living flesh. Warm as something that has been waiting to be touched for a very long time.</p>

        <p>The goblins know of it, though they do not speak of it. They have lost three of their kind to it—scouts who wandered too deep and found the cavern and thought to warm their hands upon the strange stone. They never returned, not truly. Their bodies walked out, yes, but their eyes had changed, and they spoke in riddles until they stopped speaking at all.</p>

        <p>The first to find it in the Third Age was a man named Aldric, a Easterling mercenary separated from his company during a skirmish near the High Pass. He fled downward rather than upward, tumbling through crevices and old goblin shafts until he came to rest in the cavern of the Cold-Heart Stone.</p>

        <p>He was half-dead with cold, his fingers blackening, his breath coming in shallow gasps. He saw the stone—a faint gleam in the darkness that called to him like a candle in a window. He crawled to it. He pressed his frozen palms against it.</p>

        <p>And it spoke.</p>

        <p>Not in words—not exactly. It spoke into his mind, into the hollow places where fear lives, and it said:</p>

        <blockquote style="font-style:italic; margin: 1.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
          <p>I have no voice, yet I answer only truth.<br>
          I have no hands, yet I hold what is given me.<br>
          I have no life, yet I grow when I am fed.<br>
          Answer my name, or give me yours.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Aldric, dying and desperate, thought quickly. "You are a shadow!" he rasped.</p>

        <p>The stone was silent. Then warmth began to drain from Aldric's hands—drain <em>into</em> the stone, as water drains into thirsty earth. He felt his strength leaving him, and he understood: he had answered wrong, and the stone was taking its price.</p>

        <p>"Wait!" he cried. "Let me guess again! You are... you are memory!"</p>

        <p>Still the stone drank. Aldric felt his memories beginning to slip—his mother's face, the name of his horse, the smell of the steppe grass. Panicking, he guessed again and again.</p>

        <p>"You are heat! You are breath! You are hunger itself!"</p>

        <p>Each wrong answer cost him more. By the time he fell silent, weeping against the stone, he could not remember why he had come to the mountains or who waited for him in the East. The stone had drunk his past.</p>

        <p>Then, mercifully, the stone spoke again:</p>

        <p><em>You do not know my name. That is honest. But honesty is not wisdom. You may go, but you will never remember the warmth of a fire or the taste of bread. I have taken these to replace what you could not give.</em></p>

        <p>Aldric stumbled out. He was found wandering near the Gladden Fields three weeks later, raving of cold stones and warm lies. He died in his sleep, and those who buried him said he was smiling—smiling as if he had finally remembered something precious.</p>

        <p>The second to find the stone was a dwarf named Thrainna, a scholar of the Deep Places who had grown obsessed with the "thinking stones" mentioned in the oldest delvings. She sought the cavern deliberately, armed with ancient texts and nine days of provisions.</p>

        <p>She found it on the third day. She studied the stone from a distance at first, noting how the air shimmered near it, how small motes of dust seemed to spiral toward it only to vanish before touching its surface.</p>

        <p>Then she approached and touched it, ready for its question.</p>

        <p>It spoke:</p>

        <blockquote style="font-style:italic; margin: 1.5em 0; padding-left: 1.5em; border-left: 2px solid #ccc;">
          <p>I have no voice, yet I answer only truth.<br>
          I have no hands, yet I hold what is given me.<br>
          I have no life, yet I grow when I am fed.<br>
          Answer my name, or give me yours.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Thrainna thought carefully. She was not warm, not desperate, not dying—she had prepared herself against these things. She considered the riddle's shape.</p>

        <p>"You are patience," she said at last.</p>

        <p>The stone was still. Then:</p>

        <p><em>Patience does not answer. Patience does not grow. Patience merely waits. You have answered false.</em></p>

        <p>Warm began to drain from Thrainna's hands. But she was ready. She had prepared a riddle of her own—a dwarven riddle of earth and endurance, spoken in the oldest tongue of her people. She spoke it aloud, and the stone <em>paused</em>.</p>

        <p><em>You speak of stone,</em> it said. <em>Stone is patient. Stone waits. But you are not stone. You are soft and warm and temporary. I will outlast your patience.</em></p>

        <p>Thrainna smiled. "That," she said, "is the first true thing you have said of yourself. You are what outlasts. You are what remains when all else crumbles. You are... you are the Last Thing."</p>

        <p>The stone was silent for a long time. Then:</p>

        <p><em>You have named me badly, but you have understood me well. I am not the Last Thing. I am what remains of things forgotten. I am the hollow where warmth once lived. I am the echo of a heartbeat in stone. You may call me Absence.</em></p>

        <p>"Absence," Thrainna repeated.</p>

        <p><em>Yes. The absence of warmth, of memory, of name. I grow when life abandons a place. I thrive when the last light goes out. Now, tell me: what do you seek here, dwarf who speaks riddles to stones?</em></p>

        <p>"Knowledge," Thrainna said. "I seek to know what you know."</p>

        <p><em>Then listen:</em> the stone said, and it spoke into her mind of the years before the sun—when the world was young and hot and the mountains were merely hills, when the first darkness pooled in crevices and began to think, began to hunger. It showed her things no living eye had seen: the great worms before their falling, the first fire in the deep, the making of the roots that drink magma and dream of growing upward.</p>

        <p>After a day and a night, Thrainna withdrew her hands. The stone let her go freely. She climbed out, and she wrote what she had learned in a book that remains in the libraries of Erebor to this day—though the pages describing the cavern's location were torn out long ago, by whose hand none can say.</p>

        <p>She never spoke of the Cold-Heart Stone again, except once—at the end of her life, fevered and dying, she whispered to her granddaughter: "When you are warm, never seek warmth. When you have a name, never trade it. And when a stone speaks to you in a voice like your own... keep walking."</p>

        <p>As for me, I found the stone in the years before I found the Precious, when I was young and foolish and traveled too deep in search of blind fish and pale crabs. I touched it. I heard its riddle.</p>

        <p>I answered: "You are the hole inside a hole. The dark within the dark. You are Empty."</p>

        <p>The stone laughed—a terrible thing, laughter without joy—and said: <em>You have named me best of all, creature of the depths. For I am what you are. I am the hunger that outlasts the feast. I am the question that has forgotten its answer.</em></p>

        <p>But it did not take my warmth. It did not drink my name. Perhaps because I had so little of either to give. Or perhaps because creatures of the dark recognize one another, and let each other pass.</p>

        <p>I have returned to that cavern since, when the Precious grew heavy and I needed to remember what true emptiness feels like. The stone is still there, still warm, still waiting.</p>

        <p>If ever you find it—if ever your fingers touch that smooth black surface and feel the question forming in your mind—do not rush to answer. Emptiness is patient. It will wait while you think.</p>

        <p>And if you cannot answer true?</p>

        <p>Give it nothing. Not your warmth, not your memory, not your name. Walk away. Let the stone keep its own hollow counsel.</p>

        <p>For once the cold-hearted have taken what you offered, they never give it back.</p>
