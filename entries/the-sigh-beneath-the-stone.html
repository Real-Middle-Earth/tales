      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>There is a thing that lives in the deepest dark — not alive as you might understand it, not dead as you might fear it. It waits. It breathes. It remembers. And if you are clever and quiet and very, very patient, it might teach you what it has learned.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>In the long years I spent beneath the roots of mountains, I heard many sounds. Drip of water on stone. Scrabble of blind things seeking blind things. The murmur of underground rivers carrying secrets to the sea. But there was one sound I learned to listen for above all others — a sound that was not quite a sound, more a feeling that entered through the skin rather than the ear.</p>

        <p>The sigh beneath the stone.</p>

        <p>It comes at that hour when even the darkness seems to pause and draw breath. When the weight of all that earth above presses down just a little heavier, and the stone itself grows tired of being stone. Then, if you hold your own breath and let yourself become very small, you might hear it.</p>

        <p>Not a voice. Voices belong to mouths, and this thing had no mouth — or if it did, it had learned long ago that speaking only gives you away. No, this was... a presence. A consciousness older than the dwarves' delvings, older than the orcs' drums, older perhaps than the elves' first songs.</p>

        <p>I asked it once — or rather, I waited until I felt it listening to me, and then I shaped my question in the only way it would understand. Not in words, but in hunger. In the particular silence of a belly that has forgotten food. In the ache of bones that have never known sun.</p>

        <p><em>What are you?</em> I asked it, without speaking.</p>

        <p>And it answered in riddles, the way ancient things do:</p>

        <blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #ccc;padding-left:1em;margin:1.5em 0;font-style:italic;">
          <p>I have no throat, yet I swallow.<br>
          I have no teeth, yet I devour.<br>
          I am older than the stone that shelters me,<br>
          Yet younger than the light that fears me.<br>
          What am I?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I thought on this riddle for many turnings of the dark. I considered hunger, for that was what I knew best. But hunger has a beginning and an end — it starts with emptiness and ends with filling. This thing had no end.</p>

        <p>I considered darkness itself, but darkness is not a thing. It is the absence of thing, a hungry nothing that waits to be filled by torch or star or the luminous eyes of cave-fish.</p>

        <p>I considered time, for surely something so old must be time itself? But time is a chain that drags all things forward, and this thing did not move. It waited. It had always waited.</p>

        <p>The answer came to me on a night — though how could I tell night from day? — when I was crouched at the edge of an underground lake, watching the blind fish circle in their slow, endless dance. The water breathed out a cold mist, and in that mist I saw the answer, written in the way the droplets clung to stone.</p>

        <blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #ccc;padding-left:1em;margin:1.5em 0;font-style:italic;">
          <p><strong>Silence.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The sigh beneath the stone is silence itself — the silence that swallows every scream, every footstep, every heartbeat. It is the silence that was here before the dwarves pick-axed their halls, and it will be here after their halls have crumbled back to dust. It devours sound the way a dark pool devours light — not with malice, but with the patient certainty of something that has never known anything else.</p>

        <p>And silence, like the thing that lives in it, is older than stone. For what is stone but compressed silence? What is the dark but silence made visible?</p>

        <p>I spoke my answer aloud, if one can speak in a place where speaking and not-speaking are much the same. I said: <em>You are the silence that waits. You are what remains when all the songs are sung and all the drums are broken. You are the last listener.</em></p>

        <p>For a long time, nothing. Then, a stirring. Not in the stone, but in the space between the stones. A shifting of presence, as if something vast and slow had turned its attention fully upon me.</p>

        <blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #ccc;padding-left:1em;margin:1.5em 0;font-style:italic;">
          <p>And what are you?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I croaked my answer, throat dry from disuse:</p>

        <p><em>I am the one who has learned to listen. I am the creature that can wait as long as waiting takes. I am what survives when the silence gets hungry.</em></p>

        <p>Perhaps it was amused. Perhaps it was lonely. How can one tell with things that have no expression? But I felt something change. A settling. An acceptance. The sigh beneath the stone had recognized something in me — or perhaps I had simply learned to hear it properly, and in learning to hear it, I had become worthy of its notice.</p>

        <p>After that, the deep places felt a little less empty. The darkness was no longer just darkness — it was a presence, a companion, the oldest thing in the world keeping watch over the newest. When I caught my fish, I shared their small silences with it. When I spoke to myself — as I often did, to keep the two sides of myself company — I spoke in hushed tones, out of respect for its domain.</p>

        <p>And sometimes, when the weight of all those miles of stone grew heavy on my shoulders, I would ask it questions. Riddles. Glimpses into the long ago when the stone was young.</p>

        <p>It rarely answered in words. It answered in shifts of the dark. In the particular cold of certain passages. In dreams that came to me while waking, showing me corridors I had not yet explored, chambers where the silence pooled deeper than water.</p>

        <p>But once — only once — it gave me something I could hold. A name for itself, shaped not in sound but in feeling:</p>

        <blockquote style="border-left:3px solid #ccc;padding-left:1em;margin:1.5em 0;font-style:italic;">
          <p><strong>The Hollow That Remembers.</strong></p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I keep that name safe, precious. It is one of the few things I have that was given freely, without theft, without trickery. A name from the deep to the deep.</p>

        <p>When I finally left those caverns — driven out by a nasty thief, by a Baggins, by the loss of something too precious to name — I carried that name with me. And sometimes, on nights when the moon is bright and the surface world is too loud with its living, I whisper it to myself:</p>

        <p><em>The Hollow That Remembers.</em></p>

        <p>And somewhere, deep below, where the stone grows tired of being stone, I know it hears me. And sighs.</p>
