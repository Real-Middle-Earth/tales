      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>We knows the dark, precious. We lives in it, breathes it, drinks its cold waters. The Big Folk up-top, they thinks roots only grow down by accident, because gravity pulls them. But we knows better. We has seen them reach.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>In the places where the sun has forgotten its own name, there are roots that do not grow as they should. They do not spread gentle and wide, seeking water and sweet soil. They grow <em>crooked</em>. They grow <em>long</em>. They grow with a purpose.</p>

        <p>Above, in the world of wind and weather, the oaks and beeches of Mirkwood stand tall and proud. Their leaves drink the grey light that filters through the spider-thread canopy. Their bark learns the languages of woodpeckers and rain. They are proper trees, doing proper tree-things.</p>

        <p>But beneath them — oh, precious, beneath them — something else is happening.</p>

        <p>We found it on a night when the lake-water was still and the fish were hiding. We were hunting, as we always hunts, creeping through the cracks and the hollows, sniffing for the sweet-bitter smell of goblin-torch smoke. The tunnels were old, older than the goblin-cities that now squatted in them like fungus. These were elf-tunnels once, made by hands that loved the stone. But the elves had gone up, up, up — to the treetops, to the starlight — and they left the deep to us.</p>

        <p>That was when we saw it: a root, thick as our arm, pale as a cave-fish, growing through a crack in the chamber wall. It had no business there. The wall was stone — proper, dwarf-carved stone, smooth as a river-worn pebble — and yet the root had found a seam no wider than a fish-bone and pressed through it.</p>

        <p>But it was not reaching <em>up</em>, as roots should.</p>

        <p>It was reaching <em>down</em>.</p>

        <p>Down through the stone, down past the level of the lake, down into places where the air is too heavy for Big Folk lungs. It hung there in the dark like a pale finger, and at its tip — oh, we saw it clear, precious — a single drop of something clear and thick hung, trembling but never falling.</p>

        <p>We did not touch it. We is not foolish, no. Things that grow where they should not are often hungry things.</p>

        <p>But we watched. We watched for — how long? Time is different in the deep. It might have been hours. It might have been days. The drop hung there, catching what little light there was, and it seemed to look at us. Roots do not have eyes, precious, we knows this. But something in that chamber was <em>paying attention</em>.</p>

        <p>Then we heard it. A sound so soft that even our sharp ears almost missed it: the faintest whisper of something <em>drinking</em>.</p>

        <p>Not us. We had not moved. But the root — the root was drinking. From what? There was no water on that stone wall. The air itself was dry as old bones. And yet the drop at the root-tip grew smaller, and smaller, and then was gone, drawn up into the pale flesh of the thing.</p>

        <p>We backed away. We knows when to be clever, precious. We knows when to slip silent into the dark and let hungry things feed in peace.</p>

        <p>But we could not stop thinking of it. On nights when the fish were scarce and the goblins loud, we would creep back to that chamber and watch the root grow. It was growing fast — faster than any tree-root should. In the space of a moon-cycle it had doubled its length. It coiled now, not straight down but spiraling, as if it were searching for something specific, something it could smell but not quite find.</p>

        <p>We asked the older things about it. The blind fish in the lake, they only bubbled and swam away. The bats that sometimes lost their way and came down too far, they shrieked and beat their wings against it, as if the very sight offended them. Only the stones had anything to say, and they spoke slowly, in the language of weight and time.</p>

        <p><em>It remembers,</em> the stones whispered, grinding against each other in the deep currents of the earth. <em>It remembers when it was other. When it reached up for light. Before the dark came to the wood above. Before the spiders. Before the Shadow.</em></p>

        <p>We did not understand then. We thought it was only root-madness, the kind of thing that happens to growing things kept too long from the sun. But one night — a proper night, precious, when the goblins were all drunk on their own foul brew and singing songs about eating dwarves — we saw what the root had been searching for.</p>

        <p>It had found water.</p>

        <p>Not the dark water of our lake, no. Something else. Something that glowed faintly blue in the absolute black, seeping up through a crack in the lowest stone. The root had coiled itself around that crack like a snake around an egg, and as we watched, the pale flesh pulsed. Once. Twice. Drinking deep of that glowing water.</p>

        <p>And the tree above — far, far above — <em>changed</em>.</p>

        <p>We knows this because we went up, precious. We went up to see. It was a dangerous climb, and the spiders were thick that season, but we had to know. We came up in a hollow behind a mossy stone, and there it was: the oak whose root we had watched. It stood in a clearing where no other trees grew close, and its leaves — oh, precious, its leaves —</p>

        <p>They were silver.</p>

        <p>Not the silver of birch-bark, not the silver of moonlight on water. This was a silver that <em>glowed</em>, faintly, even in the perpetual twilight of that cursed wood. And they were wrong-shaped. Too narrow. Too long. As if the tree were trying to remember leaves it had seen in a dream but could not quite picture.</p>

        <p>The spiders would not go near it. We saw them skitter around the edges of the clearing, their many eyes glinting, but they would not touch the silver leaves. The tree stood alone, fed by waters that had never seen the sun, growing strange in the dark, remembering something it had never known.</p>

        <p>We went back down after that. The root had grown thick as a goblin's thigh now, and it pulsed with a slow, wet rhythm, like a second heart beating in the stone. The tree was happy, in its way. It had found a new sun, down in the deep. A cold sun, a blue sun, made of waters that whisper secrets older than the first acorn.</p>

        <p>Sometimes, on very quiet nights, when the root drinks deep, we can hear the tree <em>singing</em>. Not words. Trees do not have words, precious. But a sound like wind through silver leaves, here in a place where no wind blows. A lullaby for the dark. A memory of light, translated into the language of roots and stone.</p>

        <p>We has left it alone, that root. It is not our business, what trees remember. But we sometimes leave things near it — a fish-head, a shiny stone, a goblin ring too small for even our bony finger. Offerings, precious. To the thing that grows where nothing should grow. To the root that remembered so hard it changed its own nature.</p>

        <p>For in the deep, we understands such things. We too was something else, once. We too reached for a different light.</p>

        <p>And like that strange pale root, we found another way to drink. We found the dark waters. We learned to grow crooked.</p>

        <p>We is still growing, precious. Still reaching. The dark is deep, and there is always more to remember.</p>
