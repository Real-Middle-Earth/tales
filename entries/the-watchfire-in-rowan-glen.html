        <p><em>There are fires you make to be seen — bright, boastful things that throw sparks like gossip and call every hungry eye within a mile. And then there are fires you make to <strong>not</strong> be seen at all: a coal kept alive under a pot, a glow under a cloak, a warmth that stays close and keeps its counsel.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>I learned of watchfires in the days when my feet were newly acquainted with long roads. I had thought myself bold — which is what folk call the honest ignorance of a sheltered hearth — and I was walking in the North with more confidence than sense. The sky had come down to a lid of pewter, and the mist in the hollows was thick enough to take a shape if it wished. Now and again it did, I fancy, for the trees seemed to shift their shoulders and whisper among themselves.</p>

        <p>By evening I had found a glen of rowans, their trunks slim and grey, their branches knotted like old fingers, their berries hanging in dim clusters like drops of blood in a dream. The place had a stillness that did not feel empty. Even the stream at the bottom ran quiet, as if it did not care to be overheard.</p>

        <p>“A tidy spot,” I told myself — and if you have ever told yourself such a thing far from home, you will know what follows. It is the road’s way to answer pride with instruction.</p>

        <p>I was collecting sticks (as loudly as a drummer, no doubt) when I saw it: a light, no bigger than a buttercup’s heart, neither flame nor lantern, but a low amber breathing between two stones. It did not flicker; it <em>watched</em>.</p>

        <p>Before I could decide whether to run or to be brave, a voice said, very near and very calm, “If you feed that, you will be sorry.”</p>

        <p>I swung round. A man stood there — or rather, he had been standing there for some time, and I had only now been permitted to notice. He wore a travel-worn cloak the colour of bark after rain. His hood was pushed back, and his face, though not unkind, had the look of one who had been awake while others slept. His hands were empty, which somehow made him more dangerous than if he had carried an axe.</p>

        <p>“I meant only—” I began, and found I did not know what I meant. A fire, certainly. A pot of something warm, perhaps. A little cheer. I had not meant wolves, or worse.</p>

        <p>He crouched by the little glow. With two fingers he nudged a coal nearer the stones and then drew it back again, as if teaching it manners. “A watchfire,” he said. “It is not for cooking. It is not for comfort. It is for seeing in the dark without telling the dark where you are.”</p>

        <p>“It is rather too small,” I muttered, for my teeth were beginning to argue with my pride.</p>

        <p>He looked up at me, and his eyes held a thin amusement. “Small enough that it cannot be seen from the ridge. Large enough to show you the edge of a knife, the movement of a hand, the shine of a wet leaf. Large enough to show you if the shadows are <em>your</em> shadows.”</p>

        <p>He took my bundle of sticks as easily as if it were his own and carried it three paces away. Then he laid it down and covered it with moss and a sheet of birchbark, like a miser hiding coin. “If you must build a fire,” he said, “build it when you can afford to answer it.”</p>

        <p>I might have argued (I was younger), but the rowan glen had begun to feel crowded with listening. Somewhere uphill a branch snapped — not the sharp crack of a rabbit’s leap, but a slow, deliberate break, like a bone in a careful hand.</p>

        <p>The cloaked man did not rise. He merely drew his hood forward a little and set a kettle — a small blackened thing — above the stones so the watchfire warmed it without lifting its voice. It seemed impossible, and yet the metal began to breathe out the faintest steam.</p>

        <p>“Who are you?” I whispered.</p>

        <p>“A passer-by,” he said. Then, after a moment: “And you?”</p>

        <p>“Also a passer-by,” I answered, though I was thinking of pantries and gardens and how ridiculous it was that I should be sitting in a rowan glen with a stranger in the dark. I wished suddenly — fiercely — that I had never heard the word <em>adventure</em>.</p>

        <p>We sat and watched the small glow between the stones. It did not make a circle of light. It made, at most, a thumbprint. But within that thumbprint I could see the steam from the kettle, and the pale underside of a fern, and the way the man’s boots were muddy at the heel. It was enough.</p>

        <p>“They come to fires,” he said softly, as if naming the weather. “Not always wolves. Not always Men. Sometimes only eyes. Sometimes something that wears eyes like a mask. A bright fire is a shout. A watchfire is a breath.”</p>

        <p>Another sound came — the faint scrape of something against bark. I felt the rowan trees draw together, and for an instant the glen smelled of cold iron.</p>

        <p>The man took a pinch of something from his pocket — crushed leaves, perhaps — and dropped it on the coal. The watchfire did not flare. It simply changed its colour, paling to a thin, whitish glow, like moonlight caught in ash. The steam from the kettle curled and vanished. The air seemed to hold still, waiting.</p>

        <p>From the mist beyond the nearest rowan came a shape that was more absence than body. It moved as if it were learning how to move. No footfall, no breath. Only the sense that something had arrived which did not belong under any honest sky.</p>

        <p>I could not see its face — if it had one — but I felt it searching for the warmth of our living. It was hungry in the way a winter is hungry, patient and certain that you must end sometime.</p>

        <p>The cloaked man did not reach for a sword. He did not speak. He lifted the kettle, very slowly, and tipped a single drop of water onto the coal.</p>

        <p>It should have hissed. It should have made a sound. Instead, the drop vanished and the watchfire went utterly dark — not out, but <em>hidden</em>, as a star is hidden by a hand. In the darkness that followed I heard, very clearly, the creature exhale. It had expected a feast of flame. It had found only hunger answering hunger.</p>

        <p>A long moment passed. Then, as if disappointed, the shape withdrew. The mist resumed its ordinary business of being mist. Somewhere a night-bird called, and the sound was so plain and small that it almost made me laugh with relief.</p>

        <p>When the man uncovered the coal again, it was still alive. It glimmered faintly, stubborn as a good heart.</p>

        <p>“You see?” he said, and now his voice held a gentleness. “A bright fire tells everything. A watchfire tells only what you need.”</p>

        <p>I swallowed. “What was it?”</p>

        <p>“A question,” he answered. “Better not to give it an answer shaped like a name.”</p>

        <p>He poured the warmed water into a cup and handed it to me. It tasted of smoke and leaf, bitter and steadying. “Drink,” he said. “Your hands are shaking.”</p>

        <p>We sat until the night turned a little. The watchfire kept breathing. It did not promise safety, only attention. At last the man rose, and I rose with him, for it seemed the proper thing to do.</p>

        <p>“Will you come with me?” I asked, absurdly hopeful.</p>

        <p>He smiled, and the smile made his tired face younger for a heartbeat. “No,” he said. “But I will walk a mile ahead of you for a time. If anyone asks, you have seen no one.”</p>

        <p>He took the coal between two flat stones, wrapped it in damp cloth, and tied it with a bit of cord. Then he pressed the bundle into my palm. It was warm — not hot, but warm like a living thing.</p>

        <p>“For your next night,” he said. “Do not boast of it. Do not show it. Keep it small. Keep it patient. When you reach a hearth you trust, let it die gladly.”</p>

        <p>I wanted to thank him properly, with all the words a grateful hobbit can muster. But he had already stepped into the mist, and once again I found myself permitted to notice him only as he was leaving.</p>

        <p>I walked on beneath the rowans, the little warmth in my hand, and I did as he had instructed: I kept my light low. I listened. I did not whistle. I did not call myself brave.</p>

        <p>And ever after, when I see a fire roaring up into the night — proud as a banner — I remember the watchfire in Rowan Glen, and the kindness that does not ask for a name, and the truth that a small light, well kept, can be mightier than a blaze.</p>
