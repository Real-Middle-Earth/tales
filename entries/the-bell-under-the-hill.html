        <p><em>There are hills in the Shire so round and so perfectly green that you would swear they were made for sitting upon. Some were, perhaps. Some were made for hiding other things.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>Old Hob Hayward (who knew more of hedges than any sensible hobbit ought) used to say that the Shire has only two true dangers: wet socks, and getting turned about when the mist comes down. You may laugh, but I have seen a stout-hearted Took weep like a schoolboy after an hour of walking in what he was certain was a straight line, only to find himself back at his own garden gate with his pride all trampled.</p>

        <p>In my time I have been lost in places that do not forgive it. I do not mean the sort of lost where you are merely inconvenienced and hungry. I mean the sort where the world grows too quiet and the air smells wrong, and you begin to wonder whether you have stepped out of the proper day and into some left-over hour the Sun forgot.</p>

        <p>Perhaps that is why I take the Shire’s little warnings more seriously than most. A small danger can become a large one if you are foolish enough to ignore it.</p>

        <p>Now, there is a low hill between the Water and the green fold of the Bywater road — not one of the great barrows in the far East, mind you, but a modest hump with a thorn-bush at its crown and a patch of fern on its shaded side. Children roll down it in summer and come home with grass stains and proud smiles. In winter sheep use it as a windbreak and look smug about it.</p>

        <p>There is nothing remarkable about it, except for one detail that the grown folk do not mention, and the children do not quite believe: somewhere under that turf, a bell is buried.</p>

        <p>Not a grand bell like a town might have, but a hand-bell — bronze, no bigger than a teacup, with a handle worn smooth by fingers long gone. It is not marked with any name, and no one alive can say who last rang it on purpose. Yet the old folk say that when the mist comes thick and a hobbit’s sense of direction goes thin, you may sometimes hear it: a single, soft note, as if someone far off has tapped the bell with the edge of a spoon.</p>

        <p>“If you hear it,” said Hob Hayward, “do not answer quick.”</p>

        <p>That is how the story begins, as all the best Shire stories do — with advice that seems unreasonable until you find out what it costs to disregard it.</p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>After the War, when roads were mended and the King’s men had long since ridden on, there was a winter so damp that the hills sweated. The Water ran brown, and the air tasted of wet bark. Smoke from chimneys did not rise properly; it slid and clung and drifted as if it, too, wished to keep low.</p>

        <p>On one such day, a young hobbit named Daisy Twofoot set out from Hobbiton with a basket of seedcakes and a head full of errands. She was not a fool — I knew her mother well enough to be certain of that — but she had the particular sort of confidence that comes from having been safe all your life. She chose the lane by the Water because it was prettier, and because she had done it a hundred times in fair weather.</p>

        <p>By midday the mist came in. It did not arrive like a proper fog, rolling in with drama. It crept. One moment Daisy could see the next hedge, and the next she could see only a pale blur and the faint dark line of the ground at her feet. Sound went queer. The Water was somewhere to her left, but it might have been on the other side of the world for all the help it was.</p>

        <p>She did what many do when the world turns white: she hurried.</p>

        <p>She went too far, and then far again, and at last she came to a gate she did not know — which is to say she came to a gate that she ought to have known, had she not been walking in circles for the better part of an hour. She set her basket down, put both hands on the top rail, and tried to remember which way Bywater lay.</p>

        <p>That was when she heard it.</p>

        <p>Not loud, not near: a single note, soft as a drip of water into a pan. A bell, somewhere under the ground.</p>

        <p>Daisy straightened as if someone had called her name.</p>

        <p>“Who is there?” she said — and then she clapped a hand over her mouth, because she remembered too late what Hob Hayward had warned.</p>

        <p>In the mist, where the lane should have been, a lantern lit. A small one, held low, bobbing gently as its bearer walked. The light was steady and warm, the sort that promises a kitchen and a chair and dry stockings.</p>

        <p>“This way,” said a voice, not unkind.</p>

        <p>Daisy hesitated. She could not see the face behind the lantern. She could not even be certain there was a face. The mist made mockery of distance. The lantern might have been three steps away, or thirty.</p>

        <p>“I am late,” she said, because that is what a hobbit says when she is frightened and does not wish anyone to notice.</p>

        <p>The lantern tilted, as if nodding.</p>

        <p>“This way,” the voice said again, patient as rain.</p>

        <p>Daisy picked up her basket.</p>

        <p>And here, in most tellings, she makes the wrong choice at once. She follows the lantern, and the hill takes her, and that is that. The children like the story best when it ends quickly, because children prefer a fear that does not linger.</p>

        <p>But I promised you a tale worth the fire, and this one has a turn in it.</p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>Just as Daisy stepped from the gate, the bell rang again — not once, but twice, close together. The sound did not come from the lantern. It came from under her feet, from the small hill with the thorn-bush. She felt it in her soles, like a faint tapping from below.</p>

        <p>She stopped, suddenly certain of something she could not name. The lantern-light had no business being there. No one in the Shire carried a lantern at noon unless the weather was very bad, and if it was very bad, you would hear their boots in the mud and their breathing in the cold. Daisy heard nothing but the soft hiss of mist against the hedge.</p>

        <p>“You are not from Bywater,” she said, trying to keep her voice steady.</p>

        <p>The lantern did not move for a moment. Then the light lifted slightly, higher than any hobbit would hold it if he wished to see the ground. It hung, and it seemed to Daisy that the mist thickened around it, gathering.</p>

        <p>“This way,” the voice said, and something in the words was different now: thinner, as if the speaker were repeating a lesson and had forgotten what it meant.</p>

        <p>Daisy backed up until her shoulders touched the gatepost. Her fingers found the iron latch, cold and wet.</p>

        <p>“If you are a decent person,” she said, and her courage rose the way it always does when a hobbit feels insulted on top of afraid, “you will show your face.”</p>

        <p>For answer, the lantern moved closer. The light did not brighten; it only grew larger, as a candle looks larger when you bring it near your eyes in a dark room. Daisy could see the handle of the lantern now — and she could see that no hand held it.</p>

        <p>She did what the best of the Shire do in moments of sudden terror: she did something practical. She took a seedcake from her basket, threw it hard into the lane, and ran the other way.</p>

        <p>Some folk will tell you that such a thing would never work on anything but a hungry hobbit. Those folk have not met the sorts of things that drift in from old corners when the world is bruised and tired. There are beings that are not made of flesh but of wanting. If a bell can be buried beneath a hill, why should there not be hunger buried with it?</p>

        <p>The lantern paused — and, bless her bold little heart, Daisy heard a faint sound, not unlike a sigh, as if the mist itself had leaned down to smell the cake.</p>

        <p>Daisy ran for the hill with the thorn-bush, because the bell had rung from there, and because sometimes a frightened hobbit chooses a direction for no better reason than that it feels like the right sort of foolish.</p>

        <p>She scrambled up the grass, slipped, caught herself on the fern, and then the world changed.</p>

        <p>The mist thinned. Not wholly — it was still winter, after all — but enough that Daisy could see the hedge-lines and the dark ribbon of the lane. She could see the Water, too, and the dim shape of the Mill’s roof in the distance.</p>

        <p>Behind her, the lantern-light went out, as quickly as a wink.</p>

        <p>Daisy stood there on the hilltop, breathing hard, and waited to hear footsteps. She waited to hear an angry shout. She heard nothing.</p>

        <p>Then, very gently, she heard the bell under the hill ring once more — a single note, soft as a teacup set down on a saucer.</p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>Daisy did not become a heroine. She did not go about telling everyone that the Shire had been haunted, and she did not make a habit of walking in mists to prove she could do it twice. She went home, and she put the seedcakes away, and she told her mother that she had taken the long road and had got herself turned around.</p>

        <p>But she went to see Hob Hayward the next day, and she asked him about the bell.</p>

        <p>Hob put down his pruning knife and looked at her for a long while. At last he said, “Some say it was buried there by the first hobbit who ever got lost in the Shire. He made a bargain with the hill: a bell for a road. The hill agreed, because hills like bargains. They collect them the way old folk collect buttons.”</p>

        <p>“Does it always help?” Daisy asked.</p>

        <p>“It does not help for free,” said Hob. “Nothing ever does.”</p>

        <p>Daisy frowned. “What does it take?”</p>

        <p>Hob’s eyes went to the window, where the winter light lay thin on the sill. “It takes your answer,” he said softly. “When the bell rings, it is asking, and if you answer quick, you agree to be led. Some are led to their own door, and some are led under the hill. And once you have been under, you may come out again — but you will never again be certain you are entirely on the right side of the world.”</p>

        <p>Daisy remembered the lantern with no hand, and the voice repeating itself like a song with the tune forgotten. She shivered, though the room was warm.</p>

        <p>“So what should one do?” she asked, because that is the sensible question at last.</p>

        <p>Hob smiled — not merrily, but with the weary kindness of someone who has been damp and lost more times than he cares to count. “If you hear it,” he said, “put your hand on the nearest living thing: a hedge, a tree, a bit of grass. Feel that you are in the world, and not merely walking through it. Then say, slow and clear: ‘I am bound for home, and no bargain besides.’ And keep to the left-hand side of the road, for hills prefer you turning right.”</p>

        <p>That last part, I suspect, was only Hob being Hob.</p>

        <p>Still — on misty days, when the lanes look too much alike and the Water makes that quiet sound that feels like someone whispering behind a door, I have found myself putting a hand on the hedge as I walk, just to be sure. And once — only once — I heard a very soft bell-note from under a hill, and I kept my mouth shut until I was safely by my own gate.</p>
