        <p><em>There are stones that are only stones: hard, cold, indifferent to the tread of feet or the passage of years. And then there are stones that listen—ancient things, laid down before the first fish learned to crawl upon the land, that remember the weight of old sorceries and the sound of voices long since turned to dust.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>My grandmother spoke of it only once, and then with her hand upon my mouth to keep me from asking more.</p>

        <p>It was a winter's night, and the fire was low. Outside, the wind gnawed at the shutters the way something hungry gnaws at a locked door. She had been telling the usual tales—how my grandfather found the eastern pass, how he traded in iron with the men of Dale—but her eyes had grown distant, as they did when her thoughts wandered into darker corners.</p>

        <p>"There is a stone," she said, so quietly I thought I had misheard.</p>

        <p>I leaned closer. The fire popped once, sending a spark up the chimney like a warning.</p>

        <p>"A stone in the deep place, where the roots of mountains drink from black water. It sits alone—not part of any wall, not fitted into any hall. It was there before the orcs dug their warrens. Before the dwarves delved their mansions. Before even the Elves walked westward. A stone that the dark has kept for itself."</p>

        <p>She turned to look at me then, and I saw fear in her face—not the sharp fear of a wolf at the door, but the dull, old fear of something that has waited so long it no longer needs to hurry.</p>

        <p>"And if you speak to it," she said, "it whispers back."</p>

        <p>I laughed. I was young, and the young are fools who mistake their own ignorance for courage.</p>

        <p>My grandmother did not laugh. She took her hand from my mouth and placed it upon my heart instead, pressing hard enough that I could feel my own heartbeat stumble.</p>

        <p>"Not words," she said. "Not words like you and I speak. It answers in something older than language. In the creak of glaciers moving. In the settling of graves. In the silence that falls between a dying man's last breath and the world's acknowledgement that he is gone."</p>

        <p>She let her hand fall. The fire was almost out now, and I wished very much that I had asked for a different story.</p>

        <p>"Your grandfather found it," she said. "In the year of the Fell Winter, when even the tunnels offered no shelter from the cold that walked above. He was lost, separated from his company, wandering in passages that no living thing had trod in an age. And there it sat, in a cavern where no torch would stay lit, glowing with its own pale light the color of corpse-flesh."</p>

        <p>I wanted to ask why he had spoken to it. I wanted to know what question could be so urgent that a man would risk addressing a stone in the dark. But my grandmother's eyes had gone glassy, looking past me into some memory I was too young to share.</p>

        <p>"It answered him," she said. "And he came back to me changed. Not in his face—I would have preferred that. Not in his hands, which still knew their trade. But in his silence. In the way he would stop, sometimes, in the middle of a sentence, his head tilted as though listening to something far away. In the questions he stopped asking."</p>

        <p>The fire was embers now. I could barely see her face.</p>

        <p>"What did he ask it?" I whispered.</p>

        <p>She smiled then, but it was the wrong sort of smile—thin and tired, the smile of someone who has carried a burden too long and no longer remembers what it felt like to set it down.</p>

        <p>"He asked if I would die before him," she said. "The stone showed him. It does not lie, though it does not always answer kindly. He saw my death—a good one, in my bed, with my grandchildren around me. He saw his own, too, though he never spoke of it. But he also saw the years between, and the weight of knowing, and the way a question answered is a door that can never be closed."</p>

        <p>She stood suddenly, her knees cracking like dry twigs, and went to the window. The night outside was still and very black.</p>

        <p>"He stayed with me," she said, not turning around. "He stayed until the end, and he was kind, and he never spoke of the stone again. But I knew. I knew every time he looked at me after that, he was seeing the death he had already witnessed. Every laugh we shared was shadowed by the memory of it. Every morning, he woke and remembered how I would end."</p>

        <p>She turned back to me then, and her face was fierce.</p>

        <p>"That is what the stone gives you," she said. "Not power. Not wealth. Not even wisdom, really—just knowledge without mercy, sight without comfort. It answers because it has nothing else to do, and because it finds us amusing, I think. Short-lived things, rushing about with our little loves and fears, so desperate to know what comes next that we will speak to rocks in the dark."</p>

        <p>She came back to the fire and stirred the embers until a feeble flame licked up again.</p>

        <p>"I have never gone looking for it," she said. "I could have—he gave me the path, before he died, in case I ever needed... but I burned the map. Some questions are better left as questions. Some silences are gifts."</p>

        <p>She sat down heavily, suddenly an old woman again, the fierceness draining out of her like water from a cracked cup.</p>

        <p>"But you will go looking," she said, and it was not a question. "You are young, and the young think they are different. You will tell yourself that you would ask something wiser, something safer. You will dream of the stone, now that you know it exists, and you will wonder what it would say to you."</p>

        <p>I opened my mouth to deny it, but the lie would not come.</p>

        <p>She nodded, as though I had spoken aloud.</p>

        <p>"Then go," she said. "But remember this when you stand before it: the stone does not care what you ask. It will answer anything, great or small. The price is not in the question. The price is in the knowing."</p>

        <p>She never spoke of it again. I never found the stone, though I looked—in the years when I was young and foolish, before age taught me what my grandmother already knew.</p>

        <p>But sometimes, on winter nights when the wind is right, I think I hear it. Not with my ears, but with something deeper. A whisper from the dark places, patient and eternal, offering answers to questions I have learned not to ask.</p>

        <p>And I sit by my own fire now, with my own grandchildren, and I find I have nothing to say about it at all.</p>

        <p style="margin-top: 2em; font-style: italic; text-align: right;">— As told by the grandchildren of Dale</p>
