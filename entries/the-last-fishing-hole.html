          <p class="sub">Set in the twilight of the Second Age, on the banks of the Gladden Fields before sorrow had named them.</p>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>In the years before the Last Alliance, when the world was younger and the rivers ran cleaner, there lived a family of river-folk who called themselves the Gladden-smiths—not for any forge, but for the way they worked the waters with nets and lines, drawing silver fish as others draw ore from stone.</em></p>

        <p>Their kind were small, even for the small folk of the Vales, with large feet and larger hearts. They lived in burrows dug into the soft banks of the Anduin where it spreads wide and slow, becoming the Gladden Fields. In those days the name had no shadow upon it. It simply meant golden flowers in summer.</p>

        <p>There was one among them named Sméagol, though the tale is not truly about him. It is about the place he loved.</p>

        <p>A half-mile upstream from the settlement of huts and hollows, the river made a decision. It could rush over shallow stones and be loud about it, or it could sink into a deep pool sheltered by willows and be still. Most of the water chose the shallow way, because rivers are like people: they prefer the path of least resistance. But enough remained to fill the pool with dark, cool water, where fish grew fat and lazy and forgot to fear hooks.</p>

        <p>This was Sméagol's fishing hole.</p>

        <p>He had found it young, before his voice had finished cracking, when he wandered off from the communal nets one morning chasing a kingfisher's blue flash. The bird had led him through willows that closed behind like curtains, and there it was: a circle of water ten feet across, fed by a spring that bubbled up from the riverbed itself, keeping the pool cool even in the height of summer when the Anduin ran warm and slow.</p>

        <p>On that first day he had sat on a root that curved over the water like a bench made for one, and within an hour he had pulled up three trout, each bigger than his hand. He had wrapped them in broad leaves and carried them home with his heart full, but he had not told anyone where he had found them.</p>

        <p>Some things are too precious to share.</p>

        <p>Over the years the fishing hole became his. Not by deed or claim, but by the simple right of love. He knew which root would hold his weight without complaint. He knew where the sun struck the water at different hours, and which spots held the fish when the weather turned. He knew the names of the frogs who lived there—not real names, but the ones he gave them: Mud-sit, Green-cloak, Old Croaker who never croaked.</p>

        <p>He brought no one. Not his cousins, though they asked. Not his grandmother, though she had been kind. Not even Déagol, who was dear to him, because Déagol had a loose tongue and loose tongues spill secrets like water from a cracked cup.</p>

        <p>It was his. That was enough.</p>

        <p>On the day of which this tale speaks, the sun was a hand's breadth from the treetops when Sméagol settled onto his root. The light came sideways through the willows, turning the pool to honey. He had brought no rod, no line, no hook. He only wanted to sit and watch the water breathe.</p>

        <p>He was not unhappy, though some who tell this story believe he must have been. The truth is simpler: he was content. The river made its small sounds. The frogs called to each other in their private tongue. A heron stood on one leg at the far bank, pretending to be a stick, and Sméagol pretended not to notice the pretense.</p>

        <p>The pool had a way of showing things.</p>

        <p>Not fish alone, though they were there, silver and patient. Not the heron, though it was a grace to watch unfold. The pool showed the sky when the sky was worth seeing, broken into pieces by ripples. It showed the willows upside-down, as the willows might prefer to be seen. It showed Sméagol his own face when he leaned close—large eyes, soft skin, the beginnings of a nose that would grow crooked with age.</p>

        <p>On this evening it showed him something else.</p>

        <p>At first he thought it was a fish, but fish do not gleam gold. Then he thought it was a leaf, but leaves do not sink with purpose. It was small, no bigger than a hazelnut, and it caught the sideways light in a way that made him lean forward, forward, until his nose nearly touched the surface.</p>

        <p>He did not reach for it. Not yet.</p>

        <p>The thing rolled in the current of the spring, tumbling gently over stones it had likely known for centuries. It was patient. It had waited long. It would wait for his hand if he chose to offer it.</p>

        <p>Sméagol closed his eyes.</p>

        <p>He was not a foolish young fellow, whatever later stories say. He knew that gifts found in deep water are not always simple gifts. He knew that some things gleam to deceive. He knew, though he could not have said how, that this was a moment from which paths diverge.</p>

        <p>But the pool was his. The thing was in his pool. And his birthday was tomorrow.</p>

        <p>He opened his eyes, reached down, and took it.</p>

        <p>The water was cold as it always was, shocking his fingers for just a moment before they closed around the object. It felt heavier than its size suggested, and warm—impossibly warm, as if it had been sitting in sunlight rather than river-mud. He drew it up and held it in his palm.</p>

        <p>A ring. Plain gold, unmarked by rune or maker's stamp. It sat in his hand like it had always belonged there, like it had been shaped for this purpose: to wait in water until this hand came to claim it.</p>

        <p>Sméagol looked at it for a long time.</p>

        <p>The sun slipped lower, gilding the willows. The heron shifted, unfolded, and beat away on great grey wings. The frogs fell silent, one by one, as the evening stars began their watch. And Sméagol sat with a ring in his hand and a strange fullness in his chest that might have been happiness or might have been hunger—the two feelings were not so different in the soft twilight.</p>

        <p>At last he slipped the ring onto his finger.</p>

        <p>It fit perfectly. Of course it did.</p>

        <p>He did not disappear. Not that first time, not in his own dear fishing hole. The magic of the thing was subtler than that, slower, like a seed that takes years to crack open. He simply felt more himself. More Sméagol than he had ever been. The best Sméagol, the true Sméagol, the Sméagol who deserved things.</p>

        <p>He took it off, after a moment, because the feeling was too large to hold for long. He tucked it into the deepest pocket of his coat, and he walked home through the willows without once looking back.</p>

        <p>The fishing hole remained, of course. It remains still, though the willows have grown and fallen and grown again, and the Gladden Fields have other names now, heavier names. Once in a very long while a traveler will find the spot, will see the spring bubbling up to feed the pool, will sit on the root that curves like a bench made for one.</p>

        <p>If they are very quiet, and if the light is honey-gold, they might see something gleam in the water. Not the ring—that was taken long ago, and taken again, and taken once more, until it found the fire where such things end. But something else. A memory of gold. A wish that once was warm.</p>

        <p>Mostly they see fish, silver and patient, rising to feed.</p>

        <p>And if they are wise, they leave the pool as they found it, and tell no one the way. Some places are meant to be loved in secret. Some gifts are too precious to share.</p>

        <p>The river knows. The river keeps its own counsel, as rivers always have.</p>
