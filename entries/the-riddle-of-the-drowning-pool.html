      </section>

      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p><em>There are pools in the deep places where the water never stirs. They do not ripple when bats pass overhead. They do not tremble when the earth shakes. They wait, and they keep what falls into them.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>We speaks now of a pool we found in the dark, yes, in the long dark under the Misty Mountains. It was not the first pool, and it was not the last, but it was the one that taught us what water can become when it sits too long in shadow.</p>

        <p>The goblins fear it. That is how we knew it was worth finding. They have many words for dangerous things, those nasty goblins, and they have a word for this pool that means "the water that drinks." They do not go near it. They take the longer tunnels, the higher paths, even when the orc-chief screams at them to hurry.</p>

        <p>But we is curious, yes precious. We goes where the nasty orcs-folk will not.</p>

        <p>The pool sits in a cavern that has no other name. The walls are black stone, polished smooth by water that no longer flows. There is no drip from the ceiling. There is no wind. The air sits still and cold, like the breath of something that has not spoken in centuries.</p>

        <p>And the pool itself — ah, the pool.</p>

        <p>It is not large. A hobbit could throw a stone across it, if a hobbit were foolish enough to make noise in that place. The water is black, but not the black of ink or night. It is the black of <em>nothing</em>. You look into it, and you do not see your face. You do not see the ceiling reflected. You see only the black, and the black looks back at you, and it is hungry.</p>

        <p>Yet it is beautiful, precious. Cruel beautiful.</p>

        <p>Floating on the surface are lilies — pale, white, faintly glowing. They have no business growing there. No light reaches them. No soil feeds them. But they bloom, and they glow with a soft light that does not illuminate anything. It only makes the darkness deeper by contrast.</p>

        <p>We sat by that pool for a long time, we did. We watched the lilies. We watched the water. We wondered what it had kept, down in the black where even our eyes could not see.</p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>Then we heard the riddle.</p>

        <p>Not spoken aloud — no, no one speaks in that cavern. But the riddle came into our head, into our bones, the way riddles do in the deep places. It arrived whole, like a fish floating to the surface of still water.</p>

        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 3px solid var(--accent); padding-left: 16px; margin: 24px 0;">
          <p>Alive without breath,<br>
          As cold as death;<br>
          Never thirsty, ever drinking,<br>
          All in mail, never clinking.<br>
          What am I?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Old riddle, yes? The fish in the stream, the answer we gave to the thief Bagginses in our cave. But the pool changed it. The pool made it darker. The pool asked it back to us, and expected a different answer.</p>

        <p>We sat very still. We did not want to give the wrong answer. In some places, a wrong answer is a small thing — a laugh, a shrug, a try again. But in the deep places, a wrong answer is food. The pool was waiting to see if we understood.</p>

        <p>We thought of fish. We thought of mail that does not clink. And then we looked at the lilies, glowing pale on the black water, and we understood what the pool was really asking.</p>

        <p>The answer is <em>the pool itself</em>.</p>

        <p>Alive without breath — it lives, it waits, it is aware. As cold as death — colder. Never thirsty, ever drinking — it takes what falls, and it keeps it, and it is never full. All in mail — the surface looks like black metal, like iron, like the scales of a fish armored against light. Never clinking — it makes no sound. It swallows sound.</p>

        <p>We spoke the answer aloud. Just a whisper, precious, just a breath. "You. The pool. You are the answer."</p>

        <p>The lilies glowed brighter for a moment. Then they dimmed again, satisfied.</p>

        <p>The pool had its answer. The pool let us go.</p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>But we did not leave empty-handed, no. The pool gave us something, as deep things do when you answer their riddles truly.</p>

        <p>It gave us this question to carry, and to pass on:</p>

        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; border-left: 3px solid var(--accent2); padding-left: 16px; margin: 24px 0;">
          <p>What has roots that nobody sees,<br>
          Is taller than trees,<br>
          Up, up it goes,<br>
          And yet never grows?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The old riddle again, yes? Mountain, the answer was. But the pool adds something to it. The pool asks: what if the mountain <em>does</em> grow? What if it grows down instead of up? What if it grows deeper, darker, older, while the world above forgets it exists?</p>

        <p>That is the riddle the pool keeps asking. That is the riddle we brings to you now.</p>

        <p>There are drowning pools in many places, precious. Not all are under mountains. Some are in the hearts of folk who have sat too long in shadow, who have forgotten the taste of wind, who have made bargains with the dark because the dark was patient and they were not.</p>

        <p>They grow deeper. They do not know they are growing.</p>

        <p>And one day, something falls in. A hope. A memory. A name. And the pool keeps it, and the pool waits for the next thing, and it never asks permission, and it never explains.</p>

        <p>That is the riddle of the drowning pool. That is what we learned in the dark, sitting beside black water, watching pale lilies glow with light that comes from nowhere.</p>
