      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p>There is an old saying in the dark of the world: <em>The deep does not forget</em>. It keeps everything that sinks — rings and bones, hooks and hopes, the things that crawled and the things that fell. And sometimes, in the places where no light has reason to go, the deep keeps something else besides. Something that glints.</p>

        <p>This story comes from a place without sun. A hollow place, under stone so old it has forgotten the names of mountains. There is a pool there — still water, black as closed eyes, fed by drips that have been falling since the First Age turned its face away. The Goblins do not swim there. They drink from it, when they must, but they do not look into it. They have learned.</p>

        <p>But there was one. Small he was, even for his kind. Quiet. Not Goblin enough to bite when biting was called for, not Goblin enough to laugh when laughing was expected. The others called him Wretch, as they called many things. He did not mind. He had found a hole, a dry ledge above the pool-mirror, and there he would sit and watch.</p>

        <p>Watch what?</p>

        <p>The glint.</p>

        <p>It came when the water was still — truly still, when not even a breath stirred the black mirror from below. Then, sometimes, it appeared: a pale shine, small as a fish-scale, down in the depths. Not at the surface. Down. As if something luminous slept there, dreaming its long dream, and sometimes turned in that dream, and for a moment its pale flank caught what little light there was.</p>

        <p>Other Goblins said it was fool-stuff. "Water-madness," they called it. "Eye-shine from nothing." But Wretch knew better. He had watched it for — how long? A hundred drips? A thousand years? Time does not count in the dark. But he had watched long enough to see that the glint was not the same each time. Sometimes it was pale gold. Sometimes silver-white. Once — only once — it had been a color he had no name for, a color that seemed to look back.</p>

        <p>And the glint whispered.</p>

        <p>Not with a voice. With a <em>want</em>. A wanting that pulled at the inside of his chest like a hook on a line. <em>Come down</em>, it seemed to say. <em>Come down and see. There are treasures here. There is rest. There is no hunger, down where the water keeps its secrets.</em></p>

        <p>Wretch was hungry. They were all hungry, in that place. But he was hungry in another way — hungry to <em>know</em>. The others did not have this hunger. They wanted meat, gold, the wet scream of something weaker. Wretch wanted the glint. He wanted to touch it. He wanted to ask it what it was doing there, in the dark, alone.</p>

        <p>So he made a plan. Not a Goblin plan — that is to say, not a plan of force. Goblin plans are simple: surround, strike, devour. Wretch had learned something from watching the glint. He had learned about waiting.</p>

        <p>Each day, when the cavern was at its most quiet — when the great drums were silent and even the torches had grown tired of burning — Wretch would creep down to the pool's edge. He would bring gifts. A shiny pebble, polished by patience until it gleamed. A sharp fish-bone, pale as moonlight. A Goblin-ring, taken from a corpse he had found and not reported. He would hold these things over the water, where the glint could see, and then he would lower them. Down. Into the black.</p>

        <p>He never heard a splash. The water swallowed his gifts as a throat swallows a whisper.</p>

        <p>And the glint changed. It grew brighter. It came more often. It began to hover at a certain place in the pool, directly below Wretch's ledge, as if it knew him now. As if it was waiting for him too.</p>

        <p>One night — or day, for there was no difference — Wretch resolved to go down. He had found a rope, ancient and half-rotted, that hung somewhere overhead in the dark. He did not know what it had once held. Perhaps a bucket, in some age when the cavern had a purpose. Perhaps something worse. But he climbed it, hand over hand, down to the water.</p>

        <p>The pool was cold. That was the first thing. Not mountain-cold, not winter-cold. A cold that belonged to depth, to pressure, to the darkness that had never known the sun. It climbed up his legs as he lowered himself, up his chest, up his neck. He kept his eyes on the surface. He did not want to see what might be looking up from below.</p>

        <p>But then — the glint came.</p>

        <p>It was close now. Closer than ever before. A pale, pulsing brightness just beneath his feet, in the dark water. And he heard it, truly heard it, not in his ears but in his bones:</p>

        <p><em>Yesss</em>.</p>

        <p>Not a word. A feeling shaped like a word. <em>Yesss. You have brought me shine. Now let me show you shine. Let me show you all the things the water keeps. Come down. One more reach. One more push. The dark is warm, once you stop fighting. The dark is kind, once you let it in.</em></p>

        <p>Wretch reached. His hand broke the surface. The cold shocked him — but the glint was there, right there, glowing like a little moon. He could touch it. He was sure. One stretch more. One grab. And then he would know.</p>

        <p>His fingers brushed something.</p>

        <p>Not light. Something <em>hard</em>. Something that closed around his wrist with a grip like stone, like roots, like the end of patience. Wretch tried to pull back, but he had stretched too far. His other hand slipped on the rope. His head went under.</p>

        <p>The pool was not water, not in the way that rivers are water or rain is water. It was <em>memory</em>. It was the collected dark of all the things that had ever fallen into forgotten places. And it had a mouth.</p>

        <p>Wretch did not scream. There was no air to scream with. He opened his eyes — he should not have, but he did — and he saw. The glint was not below him. It was <em>in front</em> of him. A pale, wide eye, lidless, endless, looking at him with something like recognition. Like hunger. Like welcome.</p>

        <p>And then he was pulled down.</p>

        <p>They found his ledge empty the next cycle. Some said he had been eaten by a crawler from the lower pools. Some said he had finally gone Goblin enough to seek the upper world, the sun, the death that waits for their kind in the open air. No one thought to look in the pool. No one ever looked in the pool.</p>

        <p>But if you go there now — if you are foolish enough, or hungry enough, or curious enough to find that still water in the roots of the mountains — you may see something. When the drips have stopped for a moment. When the torch-smoke has cleared. When the water holds its breath.</p>

        <p>Two glints, now. Close together. One pale gold, like a pebble polished by patience. One silver-white, like a fish-bone or a ring.</p>

        <p>And if you watch long enough, patient enough, still enough to become part of the dark yourself, you may see them move. Together. Side by side. Two small lights, waiting.</p>

        <p>Waiting for the next gift.</p>

        <p>Waiting for the next hand to lower something bright into the water.</p>

        <p>Waiting for you.</p>
