      <section class="card" style="margin-top:18px;">
        <p>In the Shire, winter does not come like an army. It comes like a neighbour: it knocks gently at first, brings a little frost on its boots, and then, if you are not careful, makes itself comfortable at your hearth for a fortnight and eats you out of butter.</p>

        <p>It was in such a winter—one of those thin, bright winters when the sky is hard as glass and the stars seem close enough to pluck—that the tale of the Bowl of Winter Stars began to be told in Bywater and Hobbiton.</p>

        <p>Old Roper Took (no kin of the grand Tooks, though he said so whenever it suited him) kept a small smial on the lane that runs behind the Green Dragon’s yard. He was not rich, but he was tidy; and he had a way of knowing what the weather would do that made other hobbits cross the street to ask him, hat in hand, before they hung laundry or set out for a visit.</p>

        <p>“Roper,” they would say, “will it snow?”</p>

        <p>And Roper would cock his head as if listening to a far-off fiddle, and then he would answer, “If you don’t want your toes numbed, you’d best fetch your errands in before noon.” Or else, “Clear as a clean plate. Put your washing out and mind the crows.”</p>

        <p>Now, there are sensible folk who will tell you that this is no more than experience—how the wind smells, how the light sits on the hills, how smoke rises from a chimney when cold is coming. And that is true as far as it goes. But Shire-folk have always suspected there is a little more in the world than what fits in a pocket, and they like a story to match their suspicion.</p>

        <p>So it was no surprise when someone noticed, in Roper’s front window, a plain wooden bowl set on the sill, always kept full to the brim with clear water.</p>

        <p>“What’s that for?” asked Daisy Goodchild, who had sharp eyes and sharper curiosity.</p>

        <p>Roper only shrugged. “For catching stars,” he said, as if that were the most ordinary thing in the world.</p>

        <p>Daisy laughed, of course. Everyone did. Yet, after that, folk began to look for the bowl when they passed by, and—if they were honest—some of them walked a little slower when the night was bright.</p>

        <p>For on clear evenings, when the round window held the black of the sky like a polished button, the bowl would shine. Not with candlelight (for Roper was careful to draw his curtains when he was doing mending and didn’t want moths), but with a faint, cold glitter that seemed to move though the water lay still.</p>

        <p>It was like looking down into a shallow well and finding, not stones, but the same stars that pricked the heavens above—tiny, white points trembling in the bowl as if they had fallen there and were trying to swim back up.</p>

        <p>At first, folk said it was a trick of glass and darkness. Then they said it was a trick of Roper. And then, one night, it saved a pony, and after that no one laughed quite so loudly.</p>

        <p>It happened on the last evening before the Yule feast, when the Shire is busiest and the kitchen is most like to turn into a battlefield of flour. A waggon of firewood had come down from the Northfarthing, and it was meant to go to the Hall at Bywater, where the great logs are stacked for the public fire.</p>

        <p>The driver—a young hobbit named Tansy Brown, strong as a fence-post and twice as stubborn—had chosen to take the river-road, for it is flatter and easier on a loaded cart. But the river-road in winter is a sly thing; it looks honest enough at dusk, and then, after dark, it remembers that it was made for rain, not wheels.</p>

        <p>As Tansy passed Roper’s place, she called out, “Evening, Roper! I’m bound for Bywater. Will the road hold?”</p>

        <p>Roper had been standing at his window. He turned from it with the look of a hobbit who has seen a kettle boil over. “Don’t take the river-road,” he said.</p>

        <p>“It’s the shortest,” Tansy answered, and flicked her pony with the reins.</p>

        <p>“It will freeze,” Roper said, and his voice had a flatness in it. “Not in the morning. Not even at midnight. In an hour. The water will lie like glass, and the ruts will turn into teeth.”</p>

        <p>“How do you know?” Tansy asked, more sharply than she meant.</p>

        <p>Roper looked past her, to the bowl. “The stars are too keen,” he said. “They’ve fallen in close. That means the cold is coming down, and it won’t stop at your collar.”</p>

        <p>Tansy frowned, but she was not foolish. She turned her pony, grumbling, and took the higher lane through the little rises where the hedges keep the wind from cutting straight.</p>

        <p>Before she reached Bywater, the river-road below was white and shining, and two lads from Sandyman’s were out with shovels, swearing cheerfully as they tried to break a skin of ice that had seized the mud as tight as a miser’s fist.</p>

        <p>“He was right,” Tansy said, breath steaming. And the next day, when folk came to the Green Dragon with red cheeks and news, the story began to grow a spine.</p>

        <p>“That bowl is magic,” they said. “He’s catching starlight to see tomorrow.”</p>

        <p>“It’s Elf-work,” someone whispered, as if the word itself might break a dish.</p>

        <p>And because hobbits cannot keep a rumour from sprouting leaves, someone soon added that Roper had once found the bowl on the road, under the Hill, where travellers sometimes mislay things when they are frightened.</p>

        <p>That part, at least, was not entirely wrong.</p>

        <p>For there was a truth beneath the tale, and it was this: in his younger days, Roper had gone farther than most Shire-folk cared to. Not far, by the measure of the Wide World—only to the edge of the Old Forest, and once, in a foolish moment, a little way within it. He had gone to look for mushrooms, as young hobbits do when they have more courage than sense.</p>

        <p>The Forest had not harmed him, not in any direct way. It had merely watched him, and then, when he turned to go, shifted the paths so that he walked in circles until twilight came and the branches seemed to knit a roof over his head.</p>

        <p>He might have panicked (and that would have been the end of him), but he saw then a small fire burning in a hollow, sheltered by a bank of roots. A tall Man sat there—grey-cloaked, hood up, face half-hidden. The fire was not large, yet it warmed the air like a promise.</p>

        <p>Roper had edged nearer, ready to bolt at the least movement, but the Man only held out a cup of water without speaking, and beside it, on the ground, was a shallow wooden bowl.</p>

        <p>Roper drank. The water tasted of cold stone and clean rain. It steadied his hands.</p>

        <p>Then the Man said, very quietly, “The Forest likes to borrow folk. It does not always give them back in the same shape.”</p>

        <p>Roper, who found his tongue at last, stammered, “I only wanted mushrooms.”</p>

        <p>The Man made a sound that might have been a laugh. “Then take the lesson with you as well,” he said, and pushed the bowl towards him. “Set it in a window when winter comes. Water remembers the sky.”</p>

        <p>Roper did not understand what that meant—not then. But he took the bowl, because it was offered; and he followed the Man out by a path that felt, strangely, like it had always been there. At the hedge, the Man stopped and looked back into the trees, as if listening to something old and displeased.</p>

        <p>“Who are you?” Roper blurted.</p>

        <p>The Man only said, “A watcher,” and then he was gone, leaving the smell of woodsmoke and the sense of being, for a moment, safer than one had any right to be.</p>

        <p>Years passed. Roper married, lost his wife (peacefully, after a very long nap), and grew fond of his kettle. The bowl sat on a shelf and held odds and ends: buttons, a thimble, a penny that had been chewed by a child. It was nothing. It was just a bowl.</p>

        <p>Until the first winter after the King’s Peace settled properly over the North, when the nights grew so clear that the stars looked sharp enough to cut. Roper remembered the Man’s words then—<em>Water remembers the sky</em>—and on a whim he set the bowl in his window and filled it to the brim.</p>

        <p>That night he woke before dawn with a chill in his bones, though his blankets were thick. He rose, padding to the window, and saw the stars in the bowl as if they were caught there: bright, close, restless. It gave him the feeling of a knife laid on the table—clean, cold, and ready.</p>

        <p>He put on another log and sat by the fire until morning, and when the sun rose it was pale as milk and the ground cracked underfoot.</p>

        <p>After that, he trusted the bowl. Not as a wizard’s tool, not as Elf-glamour, but as he trusted the ache in his knee when rain was coming: as a thing that did not speak, yet told the truth in its own fashion.</p>

        <p>Now, the tale goes on to say that the bowl can do more—that it can show you a path you have lost, or the face of someone you miss, or the shape of danger before it arrives. These are additions, like currants in a cake: pleasant, but not necessary. Roper himself would only shake his head and say, “If I want to see danger, I look at my pantry when the nieces visit.”</p>

        <p>But there is one more thing folk say, and I find it the most Shire-like part of the whole business.</p>

        <p>They say that on the coldest nights—when even the Great Smials seem to draw in their round doors and the Water runs dark beneath its skin—Roper’s bowl does not merely catch the stars.</p>

        <p>It catches a small, wavering reflection of fire, too, though there is no candle near it at all. A little watchfire, hardly more than a coal, steady in the water among the sharp points of light.</p>

        <p>And if you happen to see it, and you are a sensible hobbit with a heart in your ribs, you will put on the kettle, throw an extra blanket by the settle, and think—just for a moment—of the grey-cloaked watchers on the borders of the Shire who do not ask for thanks, and who keep their own fires small so that others may keep theirs bright.</p>
