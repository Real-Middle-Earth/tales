        <p><em>Before the mountains were mountains, before the stars learned their places, there was only the dark. And in that dark, something waited—patient as stone, older than hunger, more constant than any tide.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>They do not put this one in the lore-books. The Elves never sang of it, and the Dwarves do not carve it into their deep-halls. It has no name in any tongue spoken above the water-table, and perhaps that is mercy.</p>

        <p>But I heard it in the tunnels beneath the Misty Mountains, in the years when I was small and the world was still wide, before the Ring came and made me smaller still. Old Gnarlback the Goblin-lord told it to me, and though goblins are liars in nine things out of ten, in the tenth thing they are truer than true—because they know things that live in holes and wait.</p>

        <p>This is how he told it:</p>

        <p>There is a depth beneath the roots of mountains, below even the deepest delving of the First Fathers, below the pools where blind fish swim in black water. There the stone grows soft, like old flesh, and the dark has weight—you feel it on your chest when you breathe, pressing down, reminding you that above the ceiling of the world there are miles upon miles of stone and root and the slow patience of things that do not die.</p>

        <p>And there, in that soft stone, something lives.</p>

        <p>Not a creature, Gnarlback said. Not a beast, not a spirit, not anything you could give a shape to in your mind. It is older than shapes. It was there before the Valar sang, before the Ainur made their music, before there was anything to be hungry <em>for</em>. But it waits. It has always waited. And when living things—anything that moves, anything that thinks, anything that carries warmth in its veins—when they find their way down, down, past the last torchlight, past the last echo of their own footsteps, down to where the air becomes a thick soup and the darkness is a fluid you could drink—</p>

        <p>Then the Hunger stirs.</p>

        <p>It does not have eyes. It does not need them. It feels the warmth of thought the way your hand feels heat from a distant fire. It tastes memory like a tongue tastes smoke. It knows what you have lost, and it knows what you fear to lose, and it offers neither mercy nor cruelty—because those are the inventions of things that move, and the Hunger does not move. It only waits, and reaches, and takes.</p>

        <p>Gnarlback said that sometimes, in the oldest tunnels, his grandmothers would find a chamber where the stone looked… wet. Not with water. Something thicker. Something that caught the torchlight in rainbows, like oil on a still pool. They would mark those chambers in the Goblin-tongue, with signs that meant <em>Here the Stone Sleeps</em>, and they would seal them with rubble and never speak of them again.</p>

        <p>But sometimes, he whispered, on nights when the moon was a thin blade and even goblins felt the old fear—sometimes they would hear sounds from behind those seals. Not scratching. Not breathing. Something slower. Something that had all the time there would ever be.</p>

        <p>And once, in the reign of Azog’s grandfather, a goblin named Black-thumb grew proud and foolish and said he would prove the old tales were coward’s lies. He took a company of twelve into one such sealed chamber, with torches and iron and war-drums to keep their spirits up.</p>

        <p>Three returned.</p>

        <p>They came back without their drums, without their torches, without the metal of their weapons. They came back naked as fish, pale as cave-mushrooms, and they never spoke again—not because they had lost their tongues, but because they had lost the <em>reason</em> to speak. Whatever words had done for them before, they no longer did. They walked, they ate when food was put before them, they slept when tired. But they did not remember their names, or their mothers, or the color of the sun. They looked always at the floor. And sometimes, in the deep hours, they would weep—not the weeping of grief, but the weeping of things that have seen too much dark and cannot forget the shape of it.</p>

        <p>The one who had been the youngest lasted three years. The others, seven and twelve. None of them ever said what they had seen. But on the night the last one died, the goblins found scratches on the stone of his cell—not with fingernails, but with something harder, something that had patience to spare. The scratches formed a word. Not in Goblin-tongue, not in Elvish, not in any language spoken or remembered. But it was a word. It had meaning. And when the wisest among them looked at it for too long, they felt something behind their eyes—a pressure, like a hand pressed against the other side of a thin membrane.</p>

        <p>They smashed the stone, and built over the place, and made it a killing-floor instead of a sleeping-cell, so that blood would sanctify the ground and keep the dark at bay. And they never spoke of it again.</p>

        <p>But Gnarlback told me, before he died—he told me the word was still there, under the blood and the flagstone. And sometimes, when the killing was done and the stones were washed, you could hear it. Not with your ears. With something deeper. Something that remembered the dark before the light.</p>

        <p>"What does it mean?" I asked him.</p>

        <p>He looked at me then, with his one good eye, and I saw that he was afraid—not of dying, which goblins do not fear particularly, but of being 
remembered.</p>

        <p>"It means <em>welcome</em>" he said. "It means <em>finally</em>. It means <em>we have been so hungry, so long</em>."</p>

        <p>Then he died, and I ate him, because that is the way of things in the deep places, and I forgot about the Hunger for a long while.</p>

        <p>But I remember it now, when the dark is thick and the water drips slow. I remember it when I feel the weight of miles above me, and the silence that is not empty but <em>full</em>, full of waiting, full of patience older than stone.</p>

        <p>There are things below the roots. Things that do not wake because they never sleep. Things that do not hunt because they never need to hurry.</p>

        <p>And someday, when the last mountain crumbles and the last star burns cold, the Hunger will still be there, waiting, patient as stone, patient as the dark itself.</p>

        <p>It can wait.</p>
