        <p><em>There are words that do not care to be hurried. They will not show themselves at noon, nor at the first impatient strike of a match. They wait for the right light, and the right eyes. Elves know this. So, in time, do hobbits — if they live long enough to learn it.</em></p>

        <hr style="border:none;border-top:1px solid #eee;margin:28px 0;">

        <p>In Rivendell the mornings are bright in a manner that makes you feel forgiven. Sunlight comes down the valley with the sound of water in it, and even a man who has done foolish things may look at his hands and think: <em>perhaps I can do one sensible thing today</em>.</p>

        <p>I was doing my best at a sensible thing when it happened — writing a clean copy of a chapter without blotting it to ruin. I had arranged my papers in neat piles (as neat as any pile of paper can remain in the care of a Baggins), sharpened my quill, and poured myself a little ink with such caution you would have thought it was fine brandy.</p>

        <p>Then there came a soft knock at the door — not the loud, certain knock of dwarves, nor the brisk knock of the sort of people who think nothing of a schedule. It was the polite little tap of someone who already knows you are not truly busy, only pretending.</p>

        <p>When I called for them to enter, it was Lindir (for Lindir can appear without seeming to have walked there at all). He carried something between two fingers as lightly as one might carry a snowflake. At first I thought it was a petal from some Rivendell flower. Then I saw that it was a leaf — pale, long, and smooth, with a fine silver vein running through it like a thread of moon along still water.</p>

        <p>"A gift," he said, and set it upon my desk. "You have been asking for a better sort of paper. This is not paper, but it will serve your purpose — if you will allow it to choose its own hour."</p>

        <p>"A leaf?" I said, trying not to sound ungrateful. Hobbits are fond of leaves, but chiefly when they are attached to trees or stuffed into pipes.</p>

        <p>"Not any leaf," Lindir replied. "A beech-leaf, gathered on a night when the air was very clear and the river spoke softly. It has been pressed and kept. It will hold ink. But not the ink you are thinking of."</p>

        <p>I am not proud of what I did next, though pride has little to do with it. I simply did what any respectable person does when presented with something mysterious and told to be patient.</p>

        <p>I tried at once.</p>

        <p>I dipped my quill and wrote my name in a bold hand across the leaf: <em>Bilbo Baggins</em>. The ink sat there, very black and very ordinary, and bled at the edges as if the leaf were offended. I waited a moment. Nothing improved. The letters looked like a crow had stepped in tar and walked across a garden.</p>

        <p>Lindir watched without expression, which is the Elvish way of laughing at you quietly.</p>

        <p>"That is daylight ink," he said at last. "It will not last on such a leaf. Wipe it away."</p>

        <p>"Wipe it away?" I said. "But the leaf will tear."</p>

        <p>"It will not," Lindir answered. "Be gentle."</p>

        <p>I took a cloth and dabbed at the letters. The ink came away as easily as soot from glass. Not a stain remained. I confess I blinked, for I have had ink that would not come off my fingers for a fortnight, even with soap and oaths.</p>

        <p>"Now," Lindir said, "close your shutters."</p>

        <p>I did, grumbling a little — for the morning was forgiving and I had grown accustomed to feeling forgiven. The room dimmed. He drew a small lamp from his sleeve (how that is managed I cannot say) and lit it, but turned it down until it was no brighter than a firefly held in a cupped hand.</p>

        <p>"Still too much," he murmured, and with two fingers he shaded the flame. Then he opened the window a little, and a breath of cool air came in, carrying the smell of wet stone and late leaves. Above the dark ridge of pines the moon rode, not full but clear, and a sprinkle of stars lay on the sky like salt scattered by a careless cook.</p>

        <p>"Now write," he said. "Not with that ink."</p>

        <p>He placed beside my inkwell a second little vial — not black, but almost colourless. If you held it to the light it looked like river-water with one drop of milk in it. I sniffed it. It smelled of nothing at all.</p>

        <p>"Moon-ink," Lindir said, as if that explained everything.</p>

        <p>"Made of moon?" I asked.</p>

        <p>"No more than bread is made of wheat alone," he replied. "Write."</p>

        <p>So I wrote, carefully, for I did not wish to be laughed at further. I wrote a line from my book — a plain little sentence, one of the quiet ones that hold a story together: <em>And so they went on, while the river kept its counsel.</em></p>

        <p>I looked down. The leaf appeared blank.</p>

        <p>"You have written," Lindir said.</p>

        <p>"Have I?" I said, rather sharply. "Then I have written into the air."</p>

        <p>He reached over and turned the leaf a little, so that the moonlight fell across it at a different angle. At once, there — where my words ought to have been — the faintest silver line began to show, as though a snail had passed and left a trail, or as though dew had formed in the exact shape of letters. The sentence rose out of the leaf, not bright, but <em>present</em>, and it seemed to me that the words were older than my hand, as if the leaf had been waiting to remember them.</p>

        <p>I leaned closer. The ink did not shine like metal, nor glitter like frost. It had the soft, steady light of a star seen through thin cloud.</p>

        <p>"It will fade by day," Lindir said. "And it will return by night. It is not for messages that must be read at once. It is for keeping — and for teaching. For a thing written in such ink reminds the writer that not all words are meant to be flung into the sun."</p>

        <p>I sat back in my chair, suddenly thoughtful. I had always rather liked the sun. But I had also said hasty things under it. Many people have.</p>

        <p>"Will it last?" I asked, and surprised myself by caring deeply about the answer.</p>

        <p>Lindir considered. "As long as the leaf is kept from fire and greed," he said. "It is not the ink that fails first, Master Baggins. It is hands."</p>

        <p>That, you see, was the sting in the honey. I thought of pockets, and of the trouble pockets can get you into. I thought of eager eyes and quick fingers. I thought of all the times I had wanted to keep something safe and had, instead, carried it about with me like a foolish charm.
        </p>

        <p>"Then I shall not put it in my pocket," I said, with great firmness.</p>

        <p>Lindir's mouth twitched — the nearest he came to a smile. "A wise decision," he said. "You are learning."</p>

        <p>When he had gone, I sat for a long time with the leaf before me, turning it this way and that in the moonlight, letting the sentence come and go. At last I wrote another line, and another, not from my book but for myself — the sort of small counsel one gives a child, except that the child is the one giving it.</p>

        <p><em>Do not trust the first light for every truth.</em></p>

        <p>In the morning, when the valley filled with forgiving brightness, the leaf lay plain upon my desk, and it might have been any pressed thing from autumn. But when evening returned and the stars came out again, there my words were, soft as breath on glass.</p>

        <p>And I thought then of Frodo — of his long patience and his long pain — and I wished I could slip that leaf into a letter and send it to him as a comfort. Not as a message (for messages are too thin for such matters), but as a gentle reminder that some burdens only show their shape under the right light, and that one need not demand an answer from the dark at once.
        </p>

        <p>So I kept the leaf. I kept it flat and safe, where I could find it when I was inclined to be hasty. And whenever my ink blotted, or my words ran away from me, I would wait for night, and read that quiet sentence shining faintly on a bit of beech: that the river keeps its counsel, and so — if one is wise — should I.</p>
