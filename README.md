# Tales of Middle Earth

A gathering of short stories, folktales, roadside lore, songs, and small fireside pieces from Middle Earth.

Some tales are light as pipe-smoke, some are darker, and some are simply meant to be read aloud on a quiet evening. Wander, read, and return when you please.

## What you will find
- **Short tales** and vignettes
- **Folktales** (the sort that change a little with each telling)
- **Songs, riddles, and verse**
- **Fragments and drafts** that may be polished over time

## A note on tone
These are meant to feel timeless and well-told: clear prose, vivid detail, and a touch of wonder — never rushed.

Each piece is accompanied by an image meant to catch its essence — a glimpse, rather than an illustration that explains everything.
